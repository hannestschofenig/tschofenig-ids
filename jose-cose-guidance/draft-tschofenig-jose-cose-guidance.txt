     Guidance for COSE and JOSE Protocol Designers and Implementers
                 draft-tschofenig-jose-cose-guidance-00

Abstract

   JSON Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE) and CBOR Object Signing and
   Encryption (COSE) are two widely used security wrappers, which have
   been developed in the IETF and have intentionally been kept in sync.

   This document provides guidance for protocol designers developing
   extensions for JOSE/COSE and for implementers of JOSE/COSE libraries.
   Developers of application using JSON and/or JOSE should also read
   this document but are realistically more focused on the documentation
   offered by the library they are using.

1.  Introduction

   JSON Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE) has initially been designed
   to offer provide a security wrapper for access tokens used by the
   OAuth protocol, particularly a digital signature.  The wider
   applicability of a standard for describing security-related meta-data
   was, however, immediately recognized.  Today, JOSE is in widespread
   use and the functionality is spread accross various specifications
   (such as [RFC7515] for the JSON Web Signature and [RFC7516] for JSON
   Web Encryption).

   With the development of CBOR [RFC8949] a binary encoding format was
   developed to address use cases where JSON was too verbose.  A
   security wrapper that uses CBOR-based encoding was needed and CBOR
   Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) was standardized and later
   updated with [RFC9052] and [RFC9053].

   The JOSE and COSE specifications have intentionally been kept in sync
   since protocols and payloads today are often described in the Concise
   Data Definition Language (CDDL) and serialized to either JOSE or COSE
   thereby making them attractive to developers from the web and the
   embedded world at the same time.  Due to the similarity of the
   designs, the guidance provided in this document is therefore
   applicable to JOSE and COSE.

   Unfortunately, some practices cause challenges from a security point
   of view and this document captures those.  We hope that this document
   helps to design better extensions for JOSE/COSE and to make the life
   of developers easier.

   The document is structured as follows.  Section 3 describes the
   challenges with key identification.  Future versions of this document
   will add further challenges.  Section 4 then offers guidance for how
   to create better designs for JOSE/COSE.

2.  Terminology and Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Key Identification

   The security wrappers in JOSE and COSE use a simple design, at least
   for the basic functionality like digital signatures and MACs using a
   single recipient.

   The security wrapper contains the following structure:

   *  A header, which is split into a protected and unprotected
      parameters.

   *  The payload, which may be detached and will then be conveyed
      independently.  This is the payload we want to protect.  In many
      applications this payload is a JSON-based payload (in case of
      JOSE) or a CBOR-encoded payload (in case of COSE).  There are also
      standardize payloads, such as JSON Web Token (JWT) [RFC7519] and
      CBOR Web Token (CWT) [RFC8392].

   *  A digital signature, a tag (for a MAC), or a ciphertext (for
      encryption).

   The purpose of the header is to provide instructions for the
   protection of the payload, including

   *  algorithm information used to provide protection of the payload,

   *  the identification of the key to verify the digital signature,
      MAC, or encryption,

   *  X.509 certificates and certificate chains,

   *  countersignature.

   Although the layering is quite simple with the header providing the
   information to provide protection of the payload, some specifications
   and applications started to place information for key identification
   inside the payload.  This approach destroys the clear layering.

   The use of the 'kid' parameter is the preferred way to identify a key
   but nothing in [RFC7515] states that the key identification values
   must be globally unique (and therefore "collision resistant").  If a
   JOSE-/COSE-protected message is intended for external/3rd party
   recipients, then

   *  the 'kid' parameter MUST contain a globally unique value, or

   *  other header parameters when combined associated with the 'kid'
      result in a globally unique value.

   If a JOSE-/COSE-protected message is used in a domain-specific
   context only, such as within an enterprise or a workload environment,
   then the uniqueness requirements are lifted.

   The practice of placing some or all key identification into the
   payload, instead of the JOSE/COSE header, forces a parser to defer
   security processing of the payload to a later point in time, to look
   inside the payload to find the appropriate keying material and to
   subsequently verify the payload.  Since the parser implementation
   does not know what fields will be used for key identification it has
   to expose all information to an application prior to signature
   verification or MAC processing.  There is a large risk that
   application developers make security- relevant decisions already
   prior to the completion of the security processing.

   There is no need for such design since there are existing header
   parameters available to store the necessary information.  If those
   headers are insufficient, then it is always possible to define new
   header parameter to convey this information.  This approach also
   simplifies libraries since they do not need to understand the payload
   content to fetch the correct information.

   When key identification-related claims are placed in the payload,
   those claims SHOULD be repeated in the header, as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-cose-cwt-claims-in-headers] (for COSE) and in Section 5.3
   of [RFC7519] (for JOSE).  This approach should only be used as a last
   resort, when the previous two approaches cannot be used.

   Finally, an easy transition from a system using digital signatures
   over payloads to encrypted payloads is not possible since information
   needed for key look-up are found in the encrypted payload.  A re-
   design would therefore be required.

4.  Guidance

   We RECOMMEND that protocol designers and implementers use the
   available header parameter for key identification.  If the
   standardized parameters are insufficient, new header parameters can
   be defined.  Re-using existing header parameters will improve
   interoperability because there are a limited number of cases on how
   to select a key.

   Information that is needed for determining the keying material needed
   to cryptographically verify the protected payload MUST be placed into
   the header of the JOSE/COSE security wrapper.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not make requests to IANA.

6.  Security Considerations

   This specification makes security recommendations for the JOSE/COSE
   specification suite.  Therefore, it is entirely about security.
