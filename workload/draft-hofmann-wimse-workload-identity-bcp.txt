              Best Current Practice for Workload Identity
              draft-hofmann-wimse-workload-identity-bcp-00

Abstract

   The use of the OAuth 2.0 framework for container orchestration
   systems poses a challenge as managing secrets, such as client_id and
   client_secret, can be complex and error-prone.  "Service account
   token volume projection", a term introduced by Kubernetes, provides a
   way of injecting JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) to workloads.

   This document specifies the use of JWTs for client credentials in
   container orchestration systems to improve interoperability in
   orchestration systems, to reduce complexity for developers, and
   motivates authorization server to support RFC 7523.

1.  Introduction

   In workload scenarios dedicated management entities, also called
   "control plane" entities, are used to start, monitor and stop
   workloads dynamically.  These workloads typically run micro services
   that interact with each other and with other entities on the
   corporate network or on the Internet.  When one workload, acting as
   an OAuth client, wants to gain access to a protected resource hosted
   on another workload or on the Internet (referred here generically as
   a resource server) then authorization is typically required.

   OAuth has been designed to offer help in scenarios where access to
   protected resources needs to be managed dynamically in a distributed
   system.

   Each workload instance has to be provisioned with unique credentials.
   However, these credentials have to be configured prior and are then
   attached to the workload.  In addition, these credentials do not have
   an automated rotation mechanism and are valid for an unspecified
   amount of time.

   This requires manual configuration effort and the missing automated
   rotation mechanism introduce inconvenience and increase the attack
   surface.

   "Service account token volume projection" is a feature of container
   orchestration systems that allows users to create JSON Web Tokens
   (JWTs) for their workloads.  These JWTs, referred as Service Account
   Tokens, can be used as client credentials, as specified in RFC 7523

   [RFC7523].  As these tokens are managed by the "control plane" and
   simply mounted to the filesystem, a workload just needs to consume
   this file and present it to the authorization server.  In addition,
   service account token volume projection allows an expiration time on
   these JWTs to be set, allowing automated rotation of these
   credentials.  Finally, the private key for signing these tokens is
   managed by the "control plane", hence removing the manual effort of
   configuring the client_id and client_secret.

   However, there is currently no standardized way to manage these
   Service Account Tokens across container orchestrators.  This leads to
   inconsistencies, and additional effort for developers as they need to
   support different client authentication mechanisms.  In the worst
   case, this approach is ignored in favor of client_id and
   client_secret.

   This specification specifies the use of Service Account Tokens in
   container orchestration systems, which provides a secure and scalable
   way to create and manage these tokens, and ensures interoperability
   with existing OAuth-based authorization systems.

   When OAuth is used as part of the control plane entities, a Service
   Account Token is provisioned to the workload via the Agent.  This
   interaction is shown in Figure 1.

   To distinguish the entities, we use the term "Control Plane" to refer
   to the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server that is part of the cluster's
   control plane.  Since there are also two access tokens in play, we
   use the term "Service Account Token" to refer to the token issued by
   the Control Plane and thereby distinguish it from the other access
   token issued to an OAuth 2.0 client running inside the workload by
   the second authorization server.

   It is important to note that the workload does not use the Service
   Account Token with resource servers directly but instead obtains
   access tokens from this second authorization server.  To obtain these
   access tokens, the OAuth 2.0 client running in the workload uses the
   JWT client authentication grant, as defined in [RFC7523], with the
   Service Account Token as input.  The obtained access token may be a
   bearer token, or a proof-of-possession token.

   Figure 1 illustrates the interaction in the architecture graphically.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Architecture and Recommendations

   This specification relies on the use of OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749] and
   [RFC7523] for client authentication using a JWT.

   Service Account Tokens used in container orchestration systems are
   vulnerable to different types of threats, as shown in this list:

   1.  Token theft: Tokens can be stolen by attackers who have already
       gained access to a workload.  These attackers can then use these
       tokens to impersonate the workload and gain access to resources
       they should not have access to.

   2.  Token reuse: Tokens can be reused by attackers to gain access to
       the system.  However, expiration times limited the token reuse
       time.

   3.  Misconfigured service accounts: Similar to misconfigured access
       to secrets, misconfigured service accounts can lead to
       applications gaining more privileges then necessary.

   4.  Theft of token signing key: The token signing key can be stolen
       by attackers who have already gained access to the control plane.
       However, such attackers also have access to all secrets in the
       container orchestration system.  Hence, resulting in the same
       impact for use of client_id and client_secret compared to using
       Service Account Tokens.

   The following fields are populated in the Service Account Token:

   1.  The 'iss' claim MUST contain a string identifying the container
       orchestrator.

   2.  The 'sub' claim MUST contain a string identifying the workload.
       This is also the client_id according to [RFC7523].

   3.  The 'aud' claim MUST identify one or multiple authorization
       servers that are intended recipients of the Service Account Token
       for client authorization.

Appendix A.  Example

   The functionality described in this specification can be verified
   using Kubernetes.  Modern version of Kubernetes implement service
   account token volume projection, which enables the ability to inject
   the Service Account Token with a specific issuer and audience into
   the workload.

   A most important parts of the configuration are (which can be found
   at the end of the full configuration):

   1.  the path, where the application can find the token, as a file

   2.  the expiration of the token in seconds

   3.  the audience, which will be in the Service Account Token

   serviceAccountToken:
     path: token
     expirationSeconds: 7200
     audience: "https://localhost:5001/connect/token"

   The full configuration is shown below:

   The most important parts of the token, which the workload will
   obtain, looks as follows:

     "iss": "https://kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local",
     "sub": "system:serviceaccount:test:default"
   }

   A complete token example obtained by the workload is shown below.

       }
     },
     "nbf": 1691745099,
     "sub": "system:serviceaccount:test:default"
   }

   To enable the authorization server to use the Service Account Token
   for client authentication the following configuration is needed:

   1.  the client id is set to system:serviceaccount:test:default.  In
       our case we are using the default service account in the test
       namespace.

   2.  the public key of the token signing key.  This can be either
       configured manually, or dynamically by referencing the JWK
       endpoint Kubernetes exposes, which is
       https://kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local/openid/v1/jwks

   Note: Authorization servers that follow the OpenID Connect Core
   specification, which profiles RFC 7523, will unfortunately run into
   problem.  Here is the why.

   For JWT-based client authentication [OIDC] specifies the following:

   1.  The 'jti' claim is mandated for client authentication.

   2.  The 'iss' claim must match the 'sub' claim.  Since Kubernetes
       issues the tokens, and not the workload, the two do not match.

   [RFC7523], on the other hand, does not mandate the use of a 'jti'
   claim and does not mandate that the 'iss' claim equals the 'sub'
   claim.
