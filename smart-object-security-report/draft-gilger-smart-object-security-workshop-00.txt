Internet-Draft       Smart Object Security Workshop        February 2013


1.  Introduction

   In early 2011, the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) solicited
   position statements for a workshop on 'Interconnecting Smart Objects
   with the Internet' [RFC6574], aiming to get feedback from the wider
   Internet community on their experience with deploying IETF protocols
   in constrained environments.  The workshop took place in Prague on
   March, 25th, 2011.  During the workshop, a range of topics were
   discussed, including architecture, routing, energy efficiency, and
   security.  The workshop report summarizes the discussion and
   suggested several next steps.

   During the months following the workshop a number of IETF initiatives
   were started, IETF participants submitted Internet drafts, and
   hands-on coding events were organized at IETF#80 and IETF#81 to
   better facilitate the exchange of ideas.

   With the contributions on security in the IETF CoRE working group as
   well as in the IETF TLS working group it became clear that further
   discussions on security were necessary and that those would have to
   feed in implementation and deployment experience as well as a shared
   understanding how various building blocks fit into a larger
   architecture.

   The workshop on Smart Object Security was organized to bring together
   various disconnected discussions about smart object security happing
   in different IETF working groups and industry fora.  It was a one-day
   workshop, held prior to the IETF#83 in Paris on March 23, 2012.

   The workshop organizers were particularly interested to get input on
   the following topics, as outlined in the call for position papers:

   o  What techniques for issuing credentials have been deployed?

   o  What extensions are useful to make existing security protocols
      more suitable for smart objects?

   o  What type of credentials are frequently used?

   o  What experience has been gained when implementing and deploying
      application layer, transport layer, network layer, and link layer
      security mechanisms (or a mixture of all of them)?

   o  How can "clever" implementations make security protocols a better
      fit for constrained devices?

   o  Are there lessons we can learn from existing deployments?

3.  Workshop Structure

   With 36 accepted position papers there was a wealth of topics to talk
   about during the one-day workshop.  The program committee decided to
   divide the discussion into four topic areas with two or three invited
   talks per slot to get a discussion started.  This section will
   summarize the points raised by the invited speakers as well as the
   essence of the ensuing discussions.

3.1.  Requirements and Use Cases

   To design a security solution, an initial starting point is to
   understand the communication relationships, the constraints, and the
   security threats.  The typical IETF security consideration section
   describes security threats, security requirements, and security
   solutions at the level of a single protocol or a single document.  To
   offer a meaningful solution for a smart object deployment it is,
   however, necessary to go beyond this limited view to the analysis of
   the larger eco-system.  The security analysis, documented in
   [RFC3552] and in [RFC4101], still provides valuable guidance.

   Typical questions that arise are:

   1.  Who are the involved actors?

       Some usage scenarios look very simple at first but then, after a
       longer investigation, turn out to be quite complex.  The smart
       meter deployment, for example, certainly belongs to one of the
       more complex deployments due to the history of the energy
       section, see [RFC6272].

   2.  Who provisions credentials?

       Credentials may, for example, be provisioned by the end user, by
       the hardware manufacturer, an application service provider, or
       other parties.  With security provided at multiple layers,
       credentials from multiple parties may need to be provisioned.

   3.  What constraints are imposed on the design?

       For example, a constraint can be the need to interworking with
       existing infrastructure.  From an architectural point of view an
       important question is whether security is terminated at the
       border router (or proxy server) at the customer's premise or if
       end-to-end security to servers in the Internet is required.  A
       more detailed discussion can be found at
       [I-D.tschofenig-smart-object-architecture].

Internet-Draft       Smart Object Security Workshop        February 2013


   4.  What type of authorization is required by the identified actors?

       This may, for example, be authorization to get access to the
       network, or authorization at the application layer.
       Authorization decisions may be binary, or may consist of complex
       role-based access control policies.

   5.  What tasks are expected by the customer who deploys the solution?

       An end customer may, for example, be expected to enter short PIN
       codes to pair devices, might need to update the firmware, or
       needs to connect to an appliance via a Web browser to make more
       sophisticated configuration settings.  The familiarity of end-
       users with Internet-based devices certainly increases constantly
       but user interface challenges contribute to a large number of
       security weaknesses of the Internet and therefore have to be
       taken into account.

   To illustrate the differences, consider a mass-market deployment for
   end customers in comparison to a deployment that is targeting
   enterprise customers.  In the latter case, enterprise system
   administrators are likely to utilize different management systems to
   provision security and other system-relevant parameters.

   Paul Chilton demonstrated the security and usability requirements in
   a typical end-user scenario for small-scale smart lighting systems.
   These systems present a substantial challenge for providing usable
   and secure communication because they are supposed to be cheap and
   very easy to set up, ideally as easy as their "dumb" predecessors.
   The example of IP-enabled light bulbs shows that the more constrained
   devices are, the more difficult it is to get security right.  For
   this reason, and the required usability, light bulbs might just be
   the perfect example for examining the viability of security
   solutions.

   Rudolf van der Berg focused on large-scale deployments of smart
   objects, such as eBook readers, smart meters, and automobiles.  The
   use of mobile cellular networks is attractive because they are
   networks with adequate coverage and capacity on a global scale.  In
   order to make use of mobile networks you need to make use of SIM-
   based authentication.  However, at this moment the SIM is controlled
   by the operator.  These companies could also use SIM-based
   authentication for other networks, like WiFi.

   The end-user interaction may differ depending on the credentials
   being used: for a light bulb deployed in the user's home it is
   expected that the user somehow configures devices so that only, for
   example, family members can turn them on and off.  Smart objects that



Gilger & Tschofenig      Expires August 29, 2013                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft       Smart Object Security Workshop        February 2013


   are equipped with SIM-based credential infrastructure do not require
   credential management by the end-user since credential management by
   the operator can be assumed.  Switching a cellular operator may,
   however, pose challenges for these devices.

   Furthermore, we have a technology that will be both deployed by end-
   users and large enterprise customers.  While the protocol building
   blocks may be the same, there is certainly a big difference between
   deployments for large-scale industrial applications and deployments
   for regular end-users in terms of the architecture.  Between these
   two, the security requirements differ significantly, as do the
   threats.  It is difficult, if not impossible, to develop a single
   security architecture that fulfills the needs of all users while at
   the same time meeting the constraints of the smart objects.

   In the consumer market, security should not incur any overhead during
   installation.  If an end user has to invest more time or effort to
   secure a smart object network, he or she will likely not do it.
   Consumer products will often be retrofitted into the existing
   infrastructure, bought and installed by consumers themselves.  This
   means that devices will have to come pre-installed to some extent and
   will most likely interoperate only with the infrastructure provided
   by the vendor, i.e., the devices will be able to connect to the
   Internet but will only interoperate with the servers provided by the
   vendor selling the device.

   Closed systems (one bulb, one switch) typically work out of the box,
   as they have been extensively tested and often come with factory-
   configured security credentials.  Problems do arise when additional
   devices are added or when these closed systems get connected to the
   Internet.  It is still very common to ship devices with default
   passwords.  It is, however, not acceptable that a device is in a
   vulnerable, but Internet-connected, state before it has been
   correctly configured by a consumer.  It is easy to conceive that many
   consumers do not configure their devices properly and may therefore
   make it easy for an adversary to take control of the device by, for
   example, using the default password or an outdated firmware.

   Once security threats for a specific deployment scenario have been
   identified, an assessment takes place to decide what security
   requirements can be identified and what security properties are
   desirable for the solution.  As part of this process, a conscious
   decision needs to take place about which countermeasures will be used
   to mitigate certain threats.  For some security threats, the
   assessment may also lead to the conclusion that the threat is
   considered out-of-scope and therefore no technical protection is
   applied.  Different businesses are likely to come to different
   conclusions about the priorities for protection and what security



Gilger & Tschofenig      Expires August 29, 2013                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft       Smart Object Security Workshop        February 2013


   requirements will be derived.

   Which security threats are worthwhile to protect against is certainly
   in the eye of the beholder and remains an entertaining discussion
   even among security specialists.  For some of the workshop
   participants, the security threats against a smart lighting system
   were considered relatively minor compared to other smart home
   appliances.  Clearly, the threats depend on the specific application
   domain but there is a certain danger that deployments of vulnerable
   smart objects will increase.  As the systems evolve and become more
   pervasive, additional security features may be required and may be
   difficult to incorporate into the already installed base,
   particularly if smart objects have no software update mechanism
   incorporated in their initial design.  Smart objects which require
   human interaction to perform software updates will likely be
   problematic in the future.  This is particularly true for devices
   that are expected to have service schedules of five to fifteen years.
   Experience shows that security breaches that are considered to be a
   prank usually evolve very rapidly to become destructive attacks.

   Apart from the security requirements of individual households and
   users, it is also important to look at the implications of
   vulnerabilities in large-scale smart object deployments, for example
   in smart meters and the power grid.

   Finally, there is the usual wealth of other requirements that need to
   be taken into account, such as ability for remote configuration and
   software updates, the ability to deal with transfer of ownership of a
   device, avoidance of operator or vendor lock-in, crypto agility,
   minimal production, license and IPR costs, etc.

3.2.  Implementation Experience

   The second slot of the workshop was dedicated to reports from first-
   hand implementation experience.  Various participants had provided
   position papers exploring different security protocols and
   cryptographic primitives.  There were three invited talks which
   covered tiny implementations of the Constrained Application Protocol
   (CoAP) protected by Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS), a TLS
   implementation using raw public keys, as well as general experience
   with implementing public key cryptography on smart object devices.

   All three presenters demonstrated that implementations of IETF
   security protocols on various constraint devices are feasible.  This
   was confirmed by other workshop participants as well.  The overall
   code size and performance of finished implementations will depend on
   the chosen feature set.  It is fairly obvious that more features
   translate to a more complex outcome.  Luckily, IETF security



Gilger & Tschofenig      Expires August 29, 2013                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft       Smart Object Security Workshop        February 2013


   protocols in general, and DTLS/TLS is no exception, can be customized
   in a variety of ways to fit a specific deployment environment.  As
   such, an engineer will have to decide which features are important
   for a given deployment scenario, and what trade-offs can be made.
   There was also the belief that IETF security protocols offer useful
   customization features (such as different ciphersuites in TLS/DTLS)
   to select the desired combination of algorithms and cryptographic
   primitives.  The need to optimize available security protocols
   further or to even develop new cryptographic primitives for smart
   objects was questioned and not seen as worthwile by many
   participants.

   The three common constraints for security implementations on smart
   objects are code size, energy consumption, and bandwidth.  The
   importance to tailor a solution to one of these constraints depends
   on the specific deployment environment.  It might be difficult to
   develop an architecture that minimizes for all constraints at the
   same time.

   To wait for the next generation of hardware typically does not
   magically lift the constraints faced today.  The workshop
   participants again reinforced the message that was made at the
   earlier smart object workshop [RFC6574] regarding future developments
   in the smart object space: "While there are constantly improvements
   being made, Moore's law tends to be less effective in the embedded
   system space than in personal computing devices: gains made available
   by increases in transistor count and density are more likely to be
   invested in reductions of cost and power requirements than into
   continual increases in computing power.".

   The above statement is applicable to smart object designs in general;
   not only for security.  Thus, it is expected that designers will
   continue having to deal with various constraints of smart objects in
   the future.  A short description of the different classes of smart
   objects can be found in [I-D.ietf-lwig-guidance], which also provides
   security-related guidance.  The workshop participants noted that
   making security protocols suitable for smart objects must not water
   down their effectiveness.  Security functionality will demand some
   portion of the overall code size.  It will have an impact on the
   performance of communication interactions, will lead to higher energy
   consumption, and certainly make the entire product more complex.
   Still, omitting security functionality because of various constraints
   is not an option.  The experience with implementing available
   security protocol was encouraging even though the need to make
   various architectural design decisions for selecting the right set of
   protocols and protocol extensions for the job was pointed out.
   Sometimes, the leading constraint is energy consumption and in other
   cases it is main memory, CPU performance, or bandwidth.  In any case,



Gilger & Tschofenig      Expires August 29, 2013               [Page 10]

Internet-Draft       Smart Object Security Workshop        February 2013


   for an optimization it is important to look at the entire system
   rather than a single protocol or even a specific algorithm.

   Much more important than the code size of the protocols being used in
   a deployed product are other design decisions, such as the
   communication model, the number of communication partners, the
   interoperability requirements, and the threats that are being dealt
   with.  Mohit Sethi noted that even the execution time for relatively
   expensive operations like asymmetric signature generation and
   verification are within acceptable limits for very constrained
   devices, like an Arduino UNO.  In either case, public key
   cryptography will like only be used for the initial communication
   setup to establish symmetric session keys.  Perhaps surprisingly, the
   cost of transmitting data wirelessly dwarfs even expensive
   computations like public key cryptography.  Since wireless reception
   is actually the most power consuming task on a smart object,
   protocols have to be designed accordingly.

   The workshop participants shared the view that the complexity of
   security protocols is a result of desired features.  Redesigning a
   protocol with the same set of features will, quite likely, lead to a
   similar outcome in terms of code size, memory consumption, and
   performance.  It was, however, also acknowledged that the security
   properties offered by DTLS/TLS/IKEv2-IPsec may not be needed for all
   deployment environments.  DTLS, for example, offers an authentication
   and key exchange framework combined with channel security offering
   data-origin authentication, integrity protection, and (optionally)
   confidentiality protection.

   The biggest optimization in terms of code size can be gained when
   looking at the complete protocol stack, rather than only
   cryptographic algorithms.  This also includes software update
   mechanisms and configuration mechanisms, all of which have to work
   together.  What may not have been investigated enough is the
   potential of performing cross-layer and cross-protocol optimization.
   We also need to think about how many protocols for security setup we
   want to have.  Due to the desire to standardize generic building
   blocks, the ability to optimize for specific deployment environments
   has been reduced.

   Finally, it was noted that scalability of security protocols does not
   imply usability.  This means that while smart object technology might
   currently be developed in large scale industrial environments, it
   should be equally usable for consumers who want to equip their home
   with just a few light bulbs.

   For details about the investigated protocol implementations please
   consult the positions papers, such as the ones by Bergmann et al.,

   Perelman et al., Tschofenig and Raza et al..

3.3.  Authorization

   The discussion slot on authorization was meant to provide an idea of
   what kind of authorization decisions are common in smart object
   networks.  Authorization is defined as 'an approval that is granted
   to a system entity to access a system resource' [RFC4949].

   Authorization requires a view on the entire smart object lifecycle to
   determine when and how a device was added to a specific environment,
   what permissions have been granted for this device and how users are
   allowed to interact with it.  On a high level, there are two types of
   authorization schemes: First, there are those systems that utilize
   the authenticated identifier and match it against an access control
   lists.  Secondly, there are trait-based authorization mechanisms that
   separate the authenticated identifier from the authorization rights
   and utilize roles and other attributes to determine whether to grant
   or deny access to a protected resource.

   Richard Barnes looked at earlier communication security work and
   argued that the model that dominates the web today will not be enough
   for the smart object environment.  Simply identifying users by their
   credentials and servers via certificates is not something that
   translates well to smart object networks because it binds all the
   capabilities to the credentials.  The evolution in access control is
   moving in the direction of granting third parties certain
   capabilities, with OAuth [I-D.ietf-oauth-v2] being an example of a
   currently deployed technology.  Access to a resource using OAuth can
   be done purely based on the capabilities rather than on the
   authenticated identifier.

      At the time of the workshop OAuth was very much focused on HTTP-
      based protocols with early efforts to integrate OAuth into SASL
      and the GSS-API [I-D.ietf-kitten-sasl-oauth].  Further
      investigations need to be done to determine the suitability of
      OAuth as a protocol for the smart object environment.

   Richard believed that it is important to separate authentication from
   authorization right from the beginning and to consider how users are
   supposed to interact with these devices to introduce them into their
   specific usage environment (and to provision them with credentials),
   and to manage access from different parties.

   The relationship between the policy enforcement point and the policy
   decision point plays an important role regarding the standardization
   needs and the type of information that needs to be conveyed between
   these two entities.

Internet-Draft       Smart Object Security Workshop        February 2013


      For example, in a AAA context the authorization decision happens
      at the AAA server (after the user requesting access to a network
      or some application level services had been authenticated).  Then,
      the decision about granting access (or rejecting it) is
      communicated from the AAA server to the AAA client at the end of
      the network access authentication procedure.  The AAA client then
      typically enforces the authorization decision over the lifetime of
      the granted user session.  The dynamic authorization extension
      [RFC3576] to the RADIUS protocol, for example, also allows the
      RADIUS server to make dynamic changes to a previously granted user
      session.  This includes support for disconnecting users and
      changing authorizations applicable to a user session.

   The authorization decisions can range from 'only devices with
   password can use the network' to very detailed application
   specification authorization policies.  The decisions are likely to be
   more sophisticated in those use cases where ownership of devices may
   be transferred from one person to another one, group membership
   concepts may be needed, access rights may be revocable, and fine
   grained access rights have to be used.  The authorization decisions
   may also take environmental factors into account, such as proximity
   of devices to each other, physical location of the device asking
   access, or the level of authentication.  With the configuration of
   authorization policies the question arises who will create them and
   where these policies are stored.  This immediately raises the
   question about how devices are identified, and who is allowed to
   create these policies.

   Since smart objects may be limited in terms of code size, persistent
   storage, and Internet connectivity, established authorization schemes
   may not be well suited for such devices.  Obviously, delegating every
   authorization decision to another node in the network incurs a
   certain network overhead, while storing sophisticated access control
   policies directly on the smart object might be prohibitive because of
   the size of such a ruleset.  Jan Janak presented one approach to
   distribute access control policies to smart objects within a single
   administrative domain.

   In those cases where access control decisions are bound to the
   identifiers of devices and humans need to either create or verify
   these access control policies, the choice of identifier matters for
   readability and accessibility purposes.

   A single mechanism will likely not help with solving the wide range
   of authorization tasks.  From the discussions it was not clear
   whether there is a need for new authorization mechanisms or whether
   existing mechanisms can be re-used.  Examples of available protocols
   with built-in authorization mechanism are Kerberos, OAuth, EAP/AAA,

Internet-Draft       Smart Object Security Workshop        February 2013


   attribute certificates, etc.  In many cases, it is even conceivable
   that the authorization decisions are internal to the system, and that
   there is no need to standardize any additional authorization
   mechanisms or protocols at all.  In fact many of the authentication
   and key exchange protocols have authorization mechanisms built-in.

3.4.  Provisioning of credentials

   When a smart object is to be introduced into an environment, like a
   home or an enterprise network, it usually has to be provisioned with
   some credentials first.  The credentials that are configured at the
   smart object and at some entity in the network are often an implicit
   authorization to access the network or some other resource.  The
   provisioned information at the smart object will include some
   identifier of the smart object, keying material, as well as other
   configuration information (e.g., specific servers it has to interact
   with).

   Some devices will be pre-configured with default security codes or
   passwords, or will have per-device or per-user credentials pre-
   configured, when they are bought or when they arrive at the customer.

   There is a limited set of solutions available (based on the available
   interface support).  The solutions for imprinting vary between the
   enterprise and the consumer household scenarios.  For large-scale
   deployments, the time needed to pair two objects further excludes
   other schemes which rely on manual steps.

   Johannes Gilger dealt with the very basic ideas behind pairing
   schemes, including the kinds of out-of-band channels that could be
   employed and their limitations.  Imprinting and pairing protocols
   usually establish a security association between two equal devices,
   such as Bluetooth-equipped cell phones.  To deal with man-in-the-
   middle attacks during this phase, various forms of additional
   verification checks exist.  For example, devices with a display allow
   numeric values to be shown on each device and to let the user verify
   whether they match.  For other devices that have a keypad, a PIN may
   need to be entered by the user.  Where and how a smart object is to
   be paired with other devices in the network can differ substantially
   from the specific use cases and the hardware capabilities of devices.
   Note that pairing is not necessarily something that is only done once
   during the lifetime of a device.  Is group pairing something to be
   looked at?  Or can any group key establishment be reduced to pair
   wise pairing with a central master device?

   Cullen Jennings presented a model for smart objects based on a
   deployment used for IP phones.  The idea was that the smart object
   "phones home", i.e., contacts a server offered by the manufacturer,



Gilger & Tschofenig      Expires August 29, 2013               [Page 14]

Internet-Draft       Smart Object Security Workshop        February 2013


   when it is first switched on.  This initial interaction can then be
   used for managing the device and provisioning keying material for
   further use.  Proof of ownership could be done by identifying the
   user who purchased the device.  This is an approach that is
   increasingly being done today.  Another option is some kind of secret
   information enclosed in the packaging.

   For interface-constrained devices, the solution of using (semi)-
   public information in combination with an online manufacturer during
   imprinting seems like a possible solution.  This solution approach
   created a lot of discussion among the participants, as it assumes an
   Internet connection and means that the manufacturer effectively knows
   about the trust relationships of all the devices it sells.

   A few questions did arise with such a model: Will there be third
   parties which have a business interest in providing something like
   key distribution and key escrow over the lifetime of a smart object?
   For constrained devices, will it always be possible to fall back to
   the existing security associations between device and manufacturer to
   create new associations?  Obviously, we do not want the lifetime of a
   smart object limited by the manufacturer product support lifespan.
   What happens if a manufacturer goes bankrupt, changes its business
   scope, or gets bought by another company?  Will end customers not be
   able to use their smart objects anymore in such a case or will they
   loose the ability to re-sell their devices because the ownership can
   no longer be transferred?

   One important design decision is that the compromise of the
   manufacturer must not have any impact on the smart objects, which
   have already been imprinted to their new owners.  Furthermore, the
   question of how to transfer ownership, e.g. when reselling a device
   arise.  While this may not be a requirement for all devices, there
   will likely be classes of large or expensive devices where support
   for transferring the ownership is an absolute necessity.

   Industrial users are comfortable when they have to rely on the
   manufacturer during the imprinting phase, but they want to be in
   exclusive control over their devices afterwards.

   There are many classes of devices where we could assume online
   connectivity to be present, otherwise these devices would not make
   sense in the first place.  But, there are also other devices which
   need to be imprinted completely offline.

   Is it important to worry about security vulnerabilities, such as man-
   in-the-middle attacks, during the very short imprinting phase?  Is it
   realistic that an adversary is in close proximity to mount an attack?
   Especially for devices with limited capabilities, such as lightbulbs,



Gilger & Tschofenig      Expires August 29, 2013               [Page 15]

Internet-Draft       Smart Object Security Workshop        February 2013


   the concerns seemed rather small.

   What happens if such a device is not enrolled by the customer but
   still connected in a "naked" state?  How does this impact security
   and it is possible for an attacker to perform a 'drive-by' enrollment
   procedure of many devices?  How should a device behave in this
   situation?  The safest (for the user at least) would be to not allow
   the device to work with full functionality if it has not been
   enrolled.  This concern is particularly applicable for cases where
   smart objects are sold with default passwords or passwords using
   semi-public information.  Examples of those are Raspberry Pi's with
   Linux images that use a default password [RaspberryPi].

4.  Summary

   Designing for a smart object environment is about making an
   optimization decision that needs to take technical aspects, usage
   scenarios, security threats, and business models into account.  Some
   design constraints may be considered fixed while others are flexible.
   Compromises will have need to be made but those should not only go at
   the expense of security functionality.

   Designing a software update mechanism into the system is crucial to
   ensure that both functionality can be enhanced and that potential
   vulnerabilities can be fixed.  Functionality as well as security will
   need to remain unchanged for several years.  Also the importance of
   security threats changes over time.

   New research and standardization on cryptographic algorithms (like
   encryption algorithms, hash functions, keyed message digests, public
   key crypto systems) that are tailored to smart object environments
   was not seen as worthwhile by the participants.  A huge range of
   algorithms already exists and standardized authentication and key
   exchange protocols can be customized to use almost any selection of
   algorithms already today.  The integration of various building blocks
   into a complete system was considered important and this document
   highlights a number of those areas.  Searching for the smart object
   security architecture was seen as a hopeless journey given the almost
   infinite design space.
