  Nonce-based Freshness for Remote Attestation in Certificate Signing
Requests (CSRs) for the Certification Management Protocol (CMP) and for
                 Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST)
                draft-tschofenig-lamps-nonce-cmp-est-01

Abstract

   Certificate Management Protocol (CMP) and Enrollment over Secure
   Transport (EST) define protocol messages for X.509v3 certificate
   creation and management.  Both protocol provide interactions between
   client systems and PKI management entities, such as a Registration
   Authority (RA) and a Certification Authority (CA).

   CMP and EST allow an RA/CA to request additional information it has
   to provide in a certification request.  When an end entity places
   attestation Evidence in a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) it may
   need to demonstrate freshness of the provided Evidence.  Attestation
   technology today often accomplishes this task via the help of nonces.

   This document specifies how nonces are provided by an RA/CA to the
   end entity for inclusion in Evidence.

1.  Introduction

   Several protocols have been standardized to automate the management
   of certificates, such as certificate issuance, CA certificate
   provisioning, certificate renewal and certificate revocation.

   The Certificate Management Protocol (CMP) [I-D.ietf-lamps-rfc4210bis]
   defines protocol messages for X.509v3 certificate creation and
   management.  CMP provides interactions between end entities and PKI
   components, such as a Registration Authority (RA) and a Certification
   Authority (CA).

   Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST) [RFC7030][RFC8295] is another
   certificate management protocol, which provides a sub-set of the
   features offered by CMP.

   An end entity requesting a certificate from a Certification Authority
   (CA) may wish to offer believable claims about the protections
   afforded to the corresponding private key, such as whether the
   private key resides on a hardware security module or the protection
   capabilities provided by the hardware, and claims about the platform
   itself.

   To convey these claims in Evidence, as part of remote attestation,
   the remote attestation extension [I-D.ietf-lamps-csr-attestation] has
   been defined.  It describes how to encode Evidence produced by an
   Attester for inclusion in Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs), and
   any certificates necessary for validating it.

   A Verifier or Relying Party might need to learn the point in time an
   Evidence has been produced.  This is essential in deciding whether
   the included Claims can be considered fresh, meaning they still
   reflect the latest state of the Attester.

   Attestation technology available today, such as [TPM20] and
   [I-D.tschofenig-rats-psa-token], often accomplish freshness with the
   help of nonces.  More details about ensuring freshness of Evidence
   can be found in Section 10 of [RFC9334].

   Since an end entity needs to obtain a nonce from the Verifier via the
   Relying Party, this leads to an additional roundtrip.  The CSR is,
   however, a one-shot message.  For this reason CMP and EST are used by
   the end entity to obtain the nonce from the RA/CA.

   CMP and EST conveniently offer a mechanism to request information
   from the RA/CA prior to a certification request.

   Once the nonce is obtained the end entity can issue an API call to
   the Attester to request Evidence and passes the nonce as an input
   parameter into the API call.  The returned Evidence is then embedded
   into a CSR and returned to the RA/CA in a certification request
   message.

   Figure 1 shows this interaction graphically.  The nonce is obtained
   in step (1) using the extension to CMP/EST defined in this document.
   The CSR extension of [I-D.ietf-lamps-csr-attestation] is used to
   convey Evidence to the RA/CA in step (2).  The Verifier processes the
   received information and returns an Attestation Result to the Relying
   Party in step (3).

   The functionality of this document is described in two sections,
   namely:

   *  Section 3 describes how to convey the nonce CMP, and

   *  Section 4 offers the equivalent functionality for EST.

2.  Terminology and Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   The terms Attester, Relying Party, Verifier and Evidence are defined
   in [RFC9334].  The terms end entity, certification authority (CA),
   and registration authority (RA) are defined in [RFC5280].

   We use the terms Certificate Signing Request (CSR) and certification
   request interchangeably.

3.  Conveying a Nonce in CMP

   Section 5.3.19.16 of [I-D.ietf-lamps-rfc4210bis] defines the general
   request message (genm) and general response (genp).  The
   AttestationNonceRequest payload of the genm message, which is send by
   the end entity to request a nonce, contains optional details on the
   length of nonce the attester requires.  The AttestationNonceResponse
   payload of the genp message, which is sent by the CA/RA in response
   to a request message by the end entity, contains the nonce.

    GenMsg:    {id-it TBD1}, AttestationNonceRequestValue
    GenRep:    {id-it TBD2}, AttestationNonceResponseValue | < absent >

    id-it-AttestationNonceRequest OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-it TBD1 }
    AttestationNonceRequestValue ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF
                                        AttestationNonceRequestContent

    AttestationNonceRequestContent ::= SEQUENCE {
       len ::= INTEGER OPTIONAL,
       -- indicates the required length of the requested nonce
       hint ::= EvidenceHint OPTIONAL
       -- indicates the verifier the needs to provide the nonce
    }

    id-it-AttestationNonceResponse OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-it TBD2 }
    AttestationNonceResponseValue ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF
                                         AttestationNonceResponseContent

    AttestationNonceResponseContent ::= SEQUENCE {
       nonce ::= OCTET STRING
       -- contains the nonce of length len
       -- provided by the verifier indicated with hint
    }

   The use of the general request/response message exchange leads to an
   extra roundtrip to convey the nonce from the CA/RA to the end entity
   (and ultimately to the Attester inside the end entity).

   The end entity MUST construct a AttestationNonceRequest request
   message to trigger the RA/CA to transmit a nonce in the response.

   When the RA/CA receive the AttestationNonceRequest content
   information is used to determine that the end entity supports this
   specification as well as [I-D.ietf-lamps-csr-attestation].

   [Open Issue: Should request message indicate the remote attestation
   capability of the end entity rather than relying on "policy
   information"?  This may also allow to inform the CA/RA about the type
   of attestation technology/technologies available to the end entity.]

   If the end entity supports remote attestation and the policy requires
   Evidence in a CSR to be provided, the RA/CA issues a
   AttestationNonceResponse response containing a nonce.

   Figure 2 showns the interaction graphically.

                 --<<-- certification response --<<--
   Handle response
   Store certificate

   *: These steps require interactions with the Attester
   (on the EE side) and with the Verifier (on the RA/CA side).

4.  Conveying a Nonce in EST

   The EST client can request an attestation nonce for its Attester.
   This function is generally performed after requesting CA certificates
   and before other EST functions.

Internet-Draft         Nonce Extension for CMP/EST         February 2024


   The EST server MUST support the use of the path-prefix of "/.well-
   known/" as defined in [RFC5785] and the registered name of "est".
   Thus, a valid EST server URI path begins with
   "https://www.example.com/.well-known/est".  Each EST operation is
   indicated by a path-suffix that indicates the intended operation:

   The following operation is defined by this specificaion:

    +------------------------+-----------------+-------------------+
    | Operation              |Operation path   | Details           |
    +========================+=================+===================+
    | Retrieval of a nonce   | /nonce          | This section      |
    +------------------------+-----------------+-------------------+

   The operation path is appended to the path-prefix to form the URI
   used with HTTP GET to perform the desired EST operation.  An example
   valid URI absolute path for the "/nonce" operation is "/.well-
   known/est/nonce".  To retrieve a nonce, the EST client would use the
   following HTTP request-line:

   GET /.well-known/est/nonce HTTP/1.1

   The EST server MAY request HTTP-based client authentication, as
   explained in Section 3.2.3 of [RFC7030].

   If the request is successful, the EST server response MUST contain a
   HTTP 200 response code with a content-type of "application/json" and
   a JSON object [RFC7159] with the member nonce.  The expiry member is
   optional and indicates the time the nonce is considered valid.  After
   the expiry time is expired, the session is likely garbage collected.

   Below is a non-normative example of the response given by the EST
   server:

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
       "nonce": "MTIzNDU2Nzg5MDEyMzQ1Njc4OTAxMjM0NTY3ODkwMTI=",
       "expiry": "2031-10-12T07:20:50.52Z"
   }

   [Open Issue: Should we also register a content type for use with EST
   over CoAP where the nonce and the expiry field is encoded in a CBOR
   structure?]

5.  Nonce Processing Guidelines

   When the RA/CA is requested or configured to transmit a nonce to an
   end entity then it interacts with the Verifier.  The Verifier is,
   according to the IETF RATS architecture [RFC9334], "a role performed
   by an entity that appraises the validity of Evidence about an
   Attester and produces Attestation Results to be used by a Relying
   Party."  Since the Verifier validates Evidence it is also the source
   of the nonce to check for replay.

   The nonce value MUST contain a random byte sequence whereby the
   length depends on the used remote attestation technology.  Since the
   nonce is relayed with the RA/CA, it MUST be copied to the respective
   structure, as described in Section 4 and Section 3, for transmission
   to the Attester.

   For example, the PSA attestation token
   [I-D.tschofenig-rats-psa-token] supports nonces of length 32, 48 and
   64 bytes.  Other attestation technologies use nonces of similar
   length.  The assumption in this specification is that the RA/CA have
   out-of-band knowledge about the required nonce length required for
   the attestation technology used by the end entity.  The nonces of
   incorrect length will cause the remote attestation protocol to fail.

   When the end entity receives the nonce it MUST use it, if remote
   attestation is available and supports nonces.  It is better for an
   RA/CA to be aggressive in sending a nonce, at least where there is a
   reasonable chance the client supports remote attestation and the
   client should be allowed to ignore the nonce if it either does not
   support it or cannot use it for policy reasons.

   While the semantics of the attestation API and the software/hardware
   architecture is out-of-scope of this specification, the API will
   return Evidence from the Attester in a format specific to the
   attestation technology utilized.  The encoding of the returned
   evidence varies but will be placed inside the CSR, as specified in
   [I-D.ietf-lamps-csr-attestation].  The software creating the CSR will
   not have to interpret the Evidence format - it is treated as an
   opaque blob.  It is important to note that the nonce is carried in
   the Evidence, either implicitly or explicitly, and it MUST NOT be
   conveyed in CSR structures outside the Evidence payload.

   The processing of the CSR containing Evidence is described in
   [I-D.ietf-lamps-csr-attestation].  Note that the issued certificates
   does not contain the nonce, as explained in
   [I-D.ietf-lamps-csr-attestation].

6.  IANA Considerations

   [Editor's Note: The ASN.1 module OID (TBD2) and the new private
   extension (TBD1) must be registered.]

7.  Security Considerations

   This specification defines how to obtain a nonce via CMP and EST.
   This specification assumes that the nonce does not require
   confidentiality protection without impacting the security property of
   the remote attestation protocol.  [RFC9334] defines the IETF remote
   attestation architecture discusses nonce-based freshness in great
   detail.

   For the use of Evidence in the CSR the security considerations of
   [I-D.ietf-lamps-csr-attestation] are relevant to this document.
