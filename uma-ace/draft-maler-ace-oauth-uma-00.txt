  Authentication and Authorization for Constrained Environments Using
                             OAuth and UMA
                    draft-maler-ace-oauth-uma-00.txt

Abstract

   Authentication and authorization are fundamental security features
   used in Internet and Web applications.  Providing the same level of
   security functionality to the Internet of Things (IoT) environment as
   well is a logical enhancement and reduces the risk of unauthorized
   access to personal data.

   IoT devices, however, have limitations in terms of processing power,
   memory, user interface, Internet connectivity, etc.  Since many use
   cases span Web and IoT environments and the question of "Web" vs.
   "IoT" can in some cases be considered a continuum, it is required to
   find security solutions that can accommodate the capabilities and
   constraints of both environments without significant compromises.

   Thus, an approach of adapting already standardized and deployed
   authentication and authorization technologies is worth examining.
   This document describes how the Web Authorization Protocol (OAuth) in
   combination with User-Managed Access (UMA) can be used for an IoT
   environment to bring Web-scale authorization services to the IoT
   world.

1.  Introduction

   Deciding when a certain use case falls under the category of IoT and
   when it is not turns out to be a difficult task.  For this reason,
   [16] made an attempt to describe characteristics of constrained-node
   networks and highlights some of the challenges.  Companies often have

   some degree of freedom to make trade-off decisions, for example, in
   terms of cost vs. physically available resources to push the
   boundaries of what can be done with IoT devices.

   Manufacturers must take not only hardware costs into account, but
   also software development costs; reusing existing software,
   standards, practices, and expertise can help to lower the total cost
   of a product.  For this reason, this document looks at real-world use
   cases that combine hardware and software elements.  These use cases
   illustrate how OAuth 2.0 [3] and User Managed Access (UMA) [12] could
   be used to combine today's identity and access management
   infrastructure with a physical access control environment.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in "Key words for use in
   RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels" [4].

   This document leverages terminology from [3] and [12] . Especially
   pertinent definitions are paraphrased below.

   Resource Owner:  An entity capable of granting access to a protected
      resource.

   Resource Server:  The server hosting the protected resources, capable
      of accepting and responding to protected resource requests using
      access tokens.

   Authorization Server:  The server issuing access tokens to the client
      after successfully authorizing it.

   Requesting Party:  An entity (which may or may not be the same as the
      resource owner) that uses a client to seek access to a protected
      resource.

   Client:  An application making protected resource requests with the
      resource owner's authorization and on the requesting party's
      behalf.

3.  Use Cases

   Following are use cases mapped from classic OAuth and UMA Web-based
   environments to realistic environments that involve IoT devices.

3.1.  Using OAuth with Scales

   In a classic OAuth flow, an end-user (the resource owner) can enable
   a client application to call an API (at the resource server) on his
   or her behalf securely and with authorized consent, without having to
   reveal his or her credentials such as a username and password to the
   client.  An app-specific access token (issued by the authorization
   server at which the resource owner is able to authenticate), whose
   operation may be scoped to some subset of the API's capabilities, is
   substituted for the credentials instead.

   The basic OAuth architecture is shown in Figure 1 and the
   corresponding message exchange in Figure 2.

                   Figure 2: OAuth 2.0 Message Exchange.

   We can apply a similar pattern to IoT devices as well.  For example,
   envision an end-user Alice and her new purchase of an Internet-
   connected scale designed for "quantified self" scenarios.  In our
   example, the scale has a micro-controller that was pre-provisioned
   with a certificate during manufacturing enabling the device to
   authenticate itself to the vendor-authorized software update server
   as well as to other parties.  The identifier used for authentication
   of a scale is something as benign as an EU-64 serial number.

   Once a representation of both the scale's and Alice's identifiers
   have been provisioned into an online repository, and if Alice can
   demonstrate appropriate control of the device -- for example, by
   entering a confirmable PIN code or serial number that was packaged
   with the shipped device into her online account record, whether
   through a Web or mobile app -- it is possible to treat the device as
   an OAuth client and issue it an OAuth token so that it can act on
   Alice's behalf.

   The value of this association is that any API calls made by the
   scale, for example to report Alice's weight, body mass index (BMI),
   or progress against health goals into her online account, will be
   associated with her alone.  If other household members use the scale
   as well, their unique associations will ensure that their data will
   go to the right place (assuming there is a mechanism at the scale
   that allows different family members to be differentiated or even

   offers user verification.  Further, each token can be revoked and
   expired exactly like any other OAuth token.

3.2.  Using UMA with Scales

   UMA builds on top of OAuth (and optionally OpenID Connect [15]) to
   let an end-user achieve three main goals: 1) authorize other parties
   to access APIs under his or her control using client applications; 2)
   set conditions for access so that those other parties may have to
   provide "claims" and do step-up authentication to get access; and 3)
   centralize management of all these conditions for access in one cloud
   service.

   The basic architecture and flow is shown in Figure 3.  A PAT is an
   OAuth token with a scope that gives access to the UMA-standardized
   protection API; an AAT is an OAuth token with a scope that gives
   access to the UMA-standardized authorization API; and an RPT is the
   main access token issued to a requesting party, which does not rely
   on resource owner presence for issuance.

                 Figure 3: OAuth++: The UMA Architecture.

   UMA can be thought of as "OAuth++", in that it adds two major
   elements: a formal protection API presented by the authorization
   server, so that resource servers running in different domains can be
   "authorization relying parties" to it, and the "requesting party"
   concept distinct from the resource owner (as discussed in the
   terminology section above).

   Similarly to the previous use case, there is value to extending the
   Web world to the world of devices because the data originating in a
   device often travels to the cloud.  Alice may want to share her scale
   data with friends, with her doctor, or in anonymized form with a
   public health service"

   The value of using an UMA authorization server, requesting party
   tokens, and so on to manage Alice's control of her doctor's and
   others' access to the data her scale generates is that she: 1) does
   not have to be present when they request access, crafting policies



Tschofenig, et al.     Expires September 10, 2015               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft              OAuth/UMA for ACE                 March 2015


   prior to access attempts or handling access approval requests after
   attempts; 2) can demand that requesting parties present proof of
   their suitability (such as current valid hospital credentials); 3)
   can change the length permission validity, including revoking sharing
   relationships; 4) can set policies governing clients used by
   requesting parties as well; and 5) can do this from a centralizable
   authorization point, crossing multiple resource servers (and thus
   devices feeding into them).

3.3.  Using OAuth and UMA with Cars

   A connected car example illustrates other desirable aspects of IoT
   authentication and authorization.

   Alice buys a new car.  At manufacture time, the car was registered at
   the manufacturer's authorization server.  When buying the car, Alice
   can create an account at the manufacturer's website and reuse the
   already configured authorization server.  Alice installs a car
   managing mobile app on her phone to manage her car.  Alice authorizes
   the app to act on her behalf as OAuth client to perform actions, such
   as open car door, which would be similar to authorizing an app to
   send tweets on my behalf to the twitter API but in this case the
   resource server is the car and the API is accessed over Bluetooth
   Smart.

   Since the operation of opening the car can be seen as sensitive, it
   is desirable to require more than a long term access token to open
   the door and start the car.  So instead of just accepting the access
   token the authorization server, the car, may require Alice to supply
   more information and a UMA claims gathering process is started e.g.
   users enters a PIN code into her phone.

   Furthermore, Alice wants to share driving rights with her husband
   Ted. Alice is owner of the car and is authorized to add new drivers
   to the car.  To do this Alice can setup the policies at the
   authorization service governing who can do what with the car at what
   time.  Alice configures a rule that allows Ted to request a token for
   the scope of driving the car, but just as Alice, Ted is required to
   download the app, authorize it and go through a claims gathering flow
   to actually get the token to start the car using his smart phone app.

   With this delegation of rights to the car Ted could potentially even
   create a valet key with geo fenced driving range and no access to
   trunk when he leaves the car in a parking garage and thereby create a
   valet key for the physical world.

   The of use of standardized protocols allows use her own authorization
   server.  Alice could choose to unregister the car at the manufacturer

Internet-Draft              OAuth/UMA for ACE                 March 2015


   authorization server and register the car to an authorization server
   of her liking.  The car would register available resources and scopes
   and Alice could configure policies as above using her own
   authorization server.

3.4.  Using OAuth and UMA with Door Locks

   Alice, the owner of a small enterprise, buys a door lock system for
   her office.  She would expect to be able to provision policies for
   access herself, in effect acting as "system administrator" for
   herself and for her five employees.  She may also want to choose her
   own authorization server, since she wants to integrate the physical
   access control system with the rest of the resources in her company
   and the enterprise identity management system she already owns.  She
   wants to control the cloud-based file system, financial and health
   data, as well as the version control and issue tracking software.

4.  Protocol Designs for the Web and Beyond

   The design of OAuth was intentionally kept flexible to accommodate
   different deployment situations.  For example, authentication of the
   resource owner to the authorization server before granting access is
   not standardized and different authentication technologies can be
   used for that purpose.  The user interface shown to the resource
   owner when asking for access to the protected resource is not
   standardized either.

   Over the years various extensions have been standardized to the core
   OAuth protocol to reduce the need for proprietary extensions that
   offer token revocation, an access token format called JSON Web Token,
   or proof-of-possession tokens that offer an alternative security
   model for bearer tokens [1].

   Due to the nature of the Web, OAuth protocol interactions have used
   HTTPS as a transport; however, other transports have been
   investigated as well, such as OAuth for use over SASL (for use with
   email) and more recently OAuth over the Constrained Application
   Protocol (CoAP).

   This document provides the reader with information about which OAuth
   extensions will be useful for the IoT context.  In its structure it
   is very similar to the DTLS/TLS IoT profile document that explains
   what TLS extensions and ciphersuites to use for different IoT
   deployment environments.  Interestingly, very little standardization
   effort is necessary to make OAuth and UMA fit for IoT.  To a large
   extend the work is centered around using alternative transports (such
   as CoAP and DTLS instead of HTTP over TLS) to minimize the on-the-

   wire overhead and to lower code-size and to define profiles for
   highly demanded use cases.

   The UMA group, benefiting from observing the OAuth experience and
   from the era in which UMA itself has been developed, has built
   extension points into the protocol, already anticipating a need for
   flexibility in transport bindings.  Thus, UMA has three
   "extensibility profiles" that enable alternate bindings (such as
   CoAP) to be defined for communications between an authorization
   server and resource server, a resource server and client, and an
   authorization server and client respectively.  It also, similarly to
   OAuth, as other extensibility options, such as token profiling and
   the ability to extend JSON formats to suit a variety of deployment
   needs.

5.  Instantiations

   In this section we provide additional details about the use of OAuth
   and UMA for solving the use cases outlined in Section 3.  In general,
   the following specifications are utilized:

   o  OAuth 2.0 [3] for interacting with the authorization server.  The
      use of the CoAP-OAuth profile [11] maybe used but is not essential
      for the examples in this section since the client is less
      constrained.

   o  Bearer tokens and proof-of-possession tokens as two different
      security models for obtaining and presenting access tokens.
      Bearer tokens are defined in [1] and the architecture for proof-
      of-possession (PoP) tokens can be found at [6].  PoP tokens
      introduce the ability to bind credentials, such as an ephemeral
      public key, to the access token.

   o  UMA [12] for registering the resource server with the
      authorization server provided by Alice and for management of
      policy.

   o  Dynamic Client Registration [10] for the client app to register at
      the authorization server.

   o  Token introspection [13] for optionally allowing the resource
      server to verify the validity of the access token (if this step is
      not done locally at the resource server).  The use of token
      introspection over CoAP [9] reduces overhead.

   o  JSON Web Token (JWT) [8] for the format of the access token.  JSON
      Web Signatures (JWT) [7] are used for creating a signature over
      the JWT.  The use of a CBOR encoding of various JSON-based

      security specifications is under discussion to reduce the size of
      JSON-based tokens.

   o  A new Bluetooth Smart service and profile for conveying access
      tokens securely from the client to the resource server.  If CoAP
      runs between the client and a constrained resouce server then [5]
      provides additional overhead reduction.

5.1.  Car Use Case

   In the car use case, as described in Section 3.3, the car acts as the
   resource server and an application on the smart phone plays the role
   of the client.  Alice is first a delegated administrator then becomes
   a resource owner of the car.

   Alice creates an account, downloads and authorizes the mobile app:

   1.  Alice creates an account on manufacturer's website.

   2.  Alice selects that two factor authentication must be used to be
       able to start controlling car from an app.

   3.  Alice downloads app and starts it.

   4.  App has never been provisioned so a browser is started, user
       selects manufacturer's authorization server from a list.

   5.  Alice authenticates using two factors and authorizes the
       application.

   6.  Access and refresh tokens are provisioned to the app.

   Alice configures policies to add Tim as new driver:

   1.  Alice opens the car-settings page within the app.

   2.  Alice selects to add a new driver by supplying Tims email
       address.

   3.  Alice checks the checkboxes that also makes Tim a delegated
       administrator.

   4.  Alice saves the new policies.

   Alice opens car door over Bluetooth Smart:

   1.   The smartphone detects the advertising packets of the door lock
        and asks Alice whether she wants to open the car door.

Internet-Draft              OAuth/UMA for ACE                 March 2015


   2.   Alice confirms and a request is sent to the authorization server
        together with an ephemeral public key created by the phone.  The
        request indicates information about the car Alice is seeking
        access to.

   3.   The authorization server evaluates the request to open the car
        door on the specific car and verifies it against the access
        control policy.  Note that the app authenticated itself to the
        authorization server.

   4.   The authorization server prompts Alice for a PIN code using
        claims gathering.

   5.   Alice enters pin and the application communicates it to the
        authorization server.

   6.   It turns out that the system administrator has granted her
        access to that specific car and she is given access by returning
        an access token.

   7.   The smart phone app then uses the obtained access token to
        create a request (which includes the access token) over
        Bluetooth Smart using on Physical Access Control Profile, which
        is a security protocol that utilizes public key cryptography
        where the app demonstrates that it knows the private key
        corresponding to the finger of the public key found in the
        token.

   8.   The car receives the request and verifies it.

   9.   To check whether the permissions are still valid the car sends
        the access token to the introspection endpoint.

   10.  The authorization server validates the access token and returns
        information about the validity of the token to the car.  In this
        case it's a valid token.

   11.  The request is logged.

   12.  The car gets a response and opens the car door.

   Alice changes authorization server:

   1.  Alice wants to connect the car to her own authorization server
       instead of the manufacturers default authorization server.

   2.  Alice makes a request to the current authorization server to
       unbind the device from the authorization server.

Internet-Draft              OAuth/UMA for ACE                 March 2015


   3.  The authorization server validates Alice request to remove the
       authorization server.

   4.  Alice configures a new authorization server in the apps UI.

   5.  The app starts an authorization code grant flow with the private
       authorization server of Alice.  Alice logs on and authorizes the
       app to act on her behalf.

   6.  The app sends information about the new authorization server to
       the car using Bluetooth Smart.

   7.  The car registers the resource it offers with the new
       authorization server.

   8.  Alice configures herself as the car owner in the new
       authorization server.

   9.  The car unbinds itself from the old authorization server by
       invalidating the access tokens using the revocation endpoint.

5.2.  Door Lock Use Case

   In the constrained server use case, as described in Section 3.4, the
   door lock acts as the resource server and an application on the smart
   phone plays the role of the client.

   Since the client runs on a powerful smartphone standard OAuth
   according to OAuth Core can be used.  To avoid leakage of the access
   token the use of a proof-of-possession token is utilized instead of a
   bearer token.  This allows the client to demonstrate the possession
   of the private key to the client.  Both symmetric as well as
   asymmetric cryptography can be used.  The use of asymmetric
   cryptography is beneficial since it allows the client to create a
   public / private key pair and to never expose the private key to
   other parties.

   As a setup-step the following steps are taken as part of the
   enterprise IT

   1.  Alice, as the enterprise network administrator, enables the
       physical access control rights at the identity management server.

   2.  Alice downloads the enterprise physical access control system app
       on her phone.  By downloading the app she agrees to the terms of
       use and she accepts the permissions being asked for by the app.





Tschofenig, et al.     Expires September 10, 2015              [Page 13]

Internet-Draft              OAuth/UMA for ACE                 March 2015


   3.  Alice associates her smart phone app with her account by login
       into the enterprise management software, which uses a combination
       of OAuth for delegating access to the app.

   4.  The enterprise administrator configures policies at the
       authorization server to give Alice access to those parts of the
       enterprise campus based on her role in the company.

   5.  Each door lock is provisioned with an asymmetric key pair and the
       public key of the authorization server.  The public key of each
       door lock is registered with the authorization server.  Door
       locks use these keys when interacting with the authorization
       server (for authentication in case of token introspection), for
       authenticating towards the client, and for verifying the
       signature computed over the access token.

   When Alice uses her smartphone for the first time to access the
   company building the following steps take place:

   1.  The smartphone detects the advertising packets of the door lock
       and asks Alice whether she wants access.

   2.  Alice confirms and a request is sent to the authorization server
       together with an ephemeral public key created by the phone.  The
       request indicates information about the door Alice is seeking
       access to.  The request is protected using Transport Layer
       Security and uses FIDO for authentication.

   3.  The authorization server evaluates the request and verifies it
       against the access control policy.  It turns out that the system
       administrator has granted her access to that specific building
       and she is given access by returning an access token.  This
       access token includes the fingerprint of the public key provided
       in the request.  The access token is digitally signed to avoid
       any modification of the content.

   4.  The smart phone app then uses the obtained information to create
       a request (which includes the access token) over Bluetooth Smart
       using on Physical Access Control Profile, which is a security
       protocol that utilizes public key cryptography where the app
       demonstrates that it knows the private key corresponding to the
       finger of the public key found in the token.

   5.  The door lock software receives the request and verifies the
       digital signature, inspects the content (such as expiry date, and
       scope), and determines whether the fingerprint of the public key
       corresponds to the private key used by the client.  Once

Internet-Draft              OAuth/UMA for ACE                 March 2015


       successfully verified the door is unlocked, and Alice is allowed
       to enter.

   6.  The physical access control app caches the access token for
       future use.

   As a variation of the above-described procedure, the door lock might
   consult the authorization server using token introspection to
   determine the validity of the access token.  This allows the
   enterprise system software to make real-time access control decisions
   and to better gain visibility about the number of employees in the
   building (in case of an emergency).

   When Alice approaches the door next time her physical access control
   app determines that a cached access token is available and no further
   interaction with the authorization server is needed.  Decisions about
   how long to cache access tokens are a policy decision configurable
   into the system and impact the performance of the protocol execution.

6.  UMA Use Case Mapping Exercise

   An analysis of [12] suggests that its capabilities have a good
   architectural match with many published ACE use cases.  The following
   are aggregated and paraphrased versions of use cases discussed in
   [18]:

   Owner grants different resource access rights to different parties
   (U1.1, U2.3, U.3.2):

      UMA meets this use case because the requesting party is formally
      distinct from the resource owner and because each requesting
      party, and each client, is represented distinctly at each
      authorization server, able to have differential policy applied to
      it.

   Owner grants different access rights for different resources on a
   device (U1.3, U4.4, U5.2):

      UMA meets this use case because the resource server is able to
      register each resource set (according to boundaries it
      unilaterally determines) at the authorization server, so that the
      resource owner can apply policy to it distinctly.

   Owner not always present at time of access (U1.6, U5.5):

      UMA meets this use case because it is a profile of OAuth that
      defines an asynchronous authorization grant, meaning that the

Internet-Draft              OAuth/UMA for ACE                 March 2015


      client's interactions during a resource access attempt do not
      require a resource owner's interaction.

   Owner grants temporary access permissions to a party (U1.7):

      UMA meets this use case because the default, mandatory-to-
      implement permissions associated with a requesting party token
      (the "bearer" profile) are able to be time-limited and are in a
      time-limitable JSON Web Token as well.

   Owner applies verifiable context-based conditions to authorizations
   (U2.4, U4.5, U6.3):

      UMA meets this use case because a resource owner can configure an
      authorization server with policies, or an authorization server can
      apply system-default policies, to demand "trust elevation" when a
      client requests authorization data, such that a requesting party
      or client must satisfy authentication, claims-based, or (through
      extension) any other criteria prior to being issued authorization
      data.

   Owner preconfigures access rights to specific data (U3.1, U6.3):

      UMA meets this use case because it defines an asynchronous
      authorization grant, as described above.  Preconfiguration is a
      case when a resource owner sets policy prior to an access attempt.

   Owner adds a new device under protection (U4.1):

      UMA meets this use case because it enables a resource owner to
      associate a device and its corresponding resource server with an
      authorization server through consenting to the issuance of a
      protection API token (PAT), enabling the resource server to
      outsource protection of its resources to the authorization server.

   Owner puts a previously owned device under protection (U4.2):

      UMA meets this use case because a previous resource owner can
      revoke a pre-existing PAT if one existed, revoking the previous
      consent in place, and the new owner can mint a new PAT.

   Owner removes a device from protection (U4.3):

      UMA meets this use case because the resource owner can revoke the
      PAT.

   Owner revokes permissions (U4.6):

Internet-Draft              OAuth/UMA for ACE                 March 2015


      UMA meets this use case because the resource owner can configure
      the authorization server to revoke or terminate an existing
      permission.  The default, mandatory-to-implement requesting party
      token profile ("bearer") requires runtime token introspection,
      ensuring relatively timely retrieval of a revoked permission
      (barring authorization server caching policy).  Other profiles may
      have different results.

   Owner grants access only to authentic, authorized clients (U7.1,
   U7.2):

      UMA meets this use case because it enables OAuth as well as OpenID
      Connect authentication of clients, including dynamic
      authentication, and also enables resource owners to configure
      authorization servers with policy, such that only desired clients
      wielded by desired requesting parties are given access to the
      owner's resources.

7.  Security Considerations

   This specification re-uses several existing specifications, including
   OAuth and UMA, and hence the security-related discussion in those
   documents is applicable to this specification.  A reader is
   encouraged to consult [14] for a discussion of security threats in
   OAuth and ways to mitigate them.  On a high level, the security
   guidance provided in [17] will help to improve security of Internet
   of Things devices in general.

   Despite all the available guidance it is nevertheless worthwhile to
   repeat the most important aspects regarding the use of access tokens,
   which are a core security mechanism in the OAuth / UMA
   specifications.

   Safeguard bearer tokens:  Client implementations MUST ensure that
      bearer tokens are not leaked to unintended parties, as they will
      be able to use them to gain access to protected resources.  This
      is the primary security consideration when using bearer tokens and
      underlies all the more specific recommendations that follow.  This
      document also outlines the use of proof-of-possessions, which
      provide stronger security properties than bearer tokens and their
      use is RECOMMENDED.

   Validate TLS certificates:  TLS/DTLS clients MUST validate the
      certificates received during the handshaking procedure.  TLS/DTLS
      is used heavily in OAuth/UMA between various parties.  Failure to
      verify certificates will enable man-in-the-middle attacks.

Internet-Draft              OAuth/UMA for ACE                 March 2015


   Always use TLS/DTLS:  The use of TLS/DTLS is mandatory for use with
      OAuth as a default.  Particularly when bearer tokens are exchanged
      the communication interaction MUST experience communication
      security protectoin using TLS (or DTLS).  Failing to do so exposes
      bearer tokens to third parties and could consequently give
      attackers unintended access.  Proof-of-possession tokens on the
      other hand do not necessarily require the use of TLS/DTLS but TLS/
      DTLS is RECOMMENDED even in those cases since TLS/DTLS offers many
      desireable security properties, such as authentication of the
      server side.

   Issue short-lived tokens:  Authorization servers SHOULD issue short-
      lived tokens.  Using short-lived bearer tokens reduces the impact
      of them being leaked and allows easier revocation in scenarios
      where resource servers are offline.

   Issue scoped tokens:  Authorization servers MUST issue tokens that
      restrict tokens for use with a specific resource server and
      contains appropriate entitlements to control access in a fine-
      grained fashion.
