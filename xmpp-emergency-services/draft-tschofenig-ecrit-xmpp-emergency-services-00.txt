   Emergency Services Functionality with the Extensible Messaging and
                        Presence Protocol (XMPP)
                 draft-tschofenig-ecrit-xmpp-es-00.txt

Abstract

   The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) is a technology
   that enjoys widespread deployment in the instant messaging
   application domain.  While many features for XMPP had been
   standardized in the IETF as well as in the XMPP Standards Foundation
   emergency services functionality was not part of it.

   This document aims to initiate a discussion about the necessary
   emergency services functionality for XMPP.

Internet-Draft           XMPP Emergency Services              March 2012


1.  Introduction

   The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) is a technology
   for real-time communication over the Internet that uses the
   Extensible Markup Language (XML) as the base format for exchanging
   information.  XMPP provides a way to send small snippets of XML from
   one communication entity to another one.  XMPP has found usage in a
   variety of protocols, but most people use it primarily for instant
   messaging.

   With the widespread usage of XMPP on the Internet for instant
   messaging and the desire to offer multi-media emergency services
   support, i.e., any form of emergency support that goes beyond voice
   calling, a frequently asked question is those applications that
   utilize XMPP today are able to offer emergency services support
   similiar to what had been standardized for the Session Initiation
   Protocol (SIP) over the last 10 years.

   The author believes that it is time to have a discussion about the
   desired level of interoperability between XMPP and the standardized,
   implemented and even deployed IP-based emergency services
   infrastructure.  This document provides a first discussion input.
   The main part of the document focuses on the various components of
   the emergency services functionality.

3.  Interoperability Need

   At it's core the question about the required emergency services
   functionality in XMPP is a question about where to put the burden for
   the interoperability needs.  Luckily, there only seem to be two
   possible options, which are graphically shown in Figure 1 and
   Figure 2.

   In Figure 1 the XMPP is used between the XMPP client and a XMPP
   server run by some provider.  Whenever the interaction with the
   emergency services authorities are needed a gateway translates XMPP
   to SIP very similar to how legacy protocols or proprietary protocols
   are translated.  While the exact placement placment of the XMPP-to-
   SIP gateway does not matter from a protocol point of view deployment-
   wise it does.  Here we assume that the emergency services
   infrastructure only supports a single protocol, namely SIP
   internally.  This reflects the current standardization situation.

   The interworking between SIP and XMPP had been subject to earlier
   investigations, as described in [I-D.saintandre-sip-xmpp-core],
   [I-D.saintandre-sip-xmpp-media], and [I-D.saintandre-sip-xmpp-im].

   In Figure 2 we show a deployment where XMPP is used end-to-end and
   the emergency services supports XMPP in addition to SIP.

4.  Functionality

   An important aspect in the support of emergency services in XMPP is
   how far current XMPP features are equivalent to those offered by SIP.
   For SIP [I-D.ietf-ecrit-phonebcp] describes the necessary
   functionality in detail.  A similar specification is needed for XMPP
   as well.  [I-D.ietf-ecrit-phonebcp], however, relies on already
   defined functionality and as such only 'glues' the different building
   blocks together.  The sub-sections below discuss the some of these
   building blocks.

4.1.  Emergency Call Marking

   In existing telecommunications systems, there are many well-known
   communication and information services that are characterized by
   long-term stability of user- visible identifiers, decentralized
   administration of the underlying service, and a well-defined
   resolution or mapping mechanism.  [RFC5031] defines a URN namespace
   that, together with resolution protocols, allows us to define global,
   well-known services, while distributing the actual implementation
   across a large number of service-providing entities.

   [RFC5031] is not only used for marking SIP communication but it is
   also used by various emergency components, such as LoST.  [RFC5031]
   also has to be integrated into XMPP.

   Part of the emergency call marking is also the ability to indicate a
   test emergency call, as described in Section 15 of
   [I-D.ietf-ecrit-phonebcp] .

4.2.  Location

   The IETF has produced a fairly extensive set of location
   specifications that are re-used for emergency services.  The works
   falls into various categories, as described in [RFC6280] and in
   Section 6 of [RFC6443].  The requirements for obtaining high accuracy
   location information are more complex for emergency services than
   with commercial location applications due to the life critical nature
   of the service.

   Location Formats:

      There are two main format standardized for location information,
      namely civic location and geodetic location information.  The main
      civic location standard can be found in [RFC5139] and the profile
      for geodetic information is available with [RFC5491] which offers
      a range of location shapes.  Various additional extensions have
      been developed, such as the support for relative location



Tschofenig              Expires September 6, 2012               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft           XMPP Emergency Services              March 2012


      [I-D.ietf-geopriv-relative-location] and location civic addresses
      [I-D.ietf-geopriv-local-civic].  It is also important to mention
      that there have been efforts ongoing to map the civic addresses in
      various countries to the PIDF-LO civic location tokens, based on
      the recommendations in [RFC5774].

   Location Encoding:

      There are mainly two encodings of location information, namely a
      binary encoding as for example used by DHCP location extensions
      and an XML-based encoding based on PIDF-LO [RFC4119].  Note that
      the PIDF-LO element contains more than pure location but also
      provides information about the entity that constructed the
      location object (based on the 'provided-by' element )and the
      utilized location determination technique (based on values from
      the IANA registry, the so-called 'method' token' registry).

   Location Configuration Protocols:

      A Location Configuration Protocol (LCP) [RFC5687] is one mechanism
      that can be used by a device to discover its own location from a
      LIS.  Several LCPs have been developed within Geopriv, such as
      [RFC5985].

   Location Derefencing:

      For location derefencing two protocols have been defined, namely
      one based on HTTP [I-D.ietf-geopriv-deref-protocol] and another
      one based on SIP which may use filters to reduce the number of
      asynchronous notifications [RFC6447].  A session setup protocol
      has to support the ability to convey these references.

   Location Conveyance:

      The ability to convey a PIDF-LO and a location by reference in SIP
      had been defined by [RFC6442].  For a single call there may be
      more than one location object in a call.

   While there is a location extensions available in XMPP with XEP-0080
   [XEP-0080] they are not equivalent from a functionality point of
   view.  XEP-0080 offers civic and geodetic location formats based on
   an XML encoding and allows this information to be conveyed in XMPP.
   A table with a mapping to the PIDF-LO semantic is also provided but
   unfortunately since the functionality is not equivalent to the list
   presented above there will be a loss of information during the
   lifecyle of location handling in most of the scenarios.

Internet-Draft           XMPP Emergency Services              March 2012


4.3.  Routing

   The LoST protocol [RFC5222] offers the ability to discover service
   contact URIs based on provided service identifiers and location
   information.  In particular, it can be used to determine the
   location-appropriate Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) for
   emergency services.  During the design of LoST it was already
   anticipated that service contact URIs based on a variety of different
   protocols (not only SIP) will be needed.  As such, XMPP is seamlessly
   supported by LoST.

4.4.  Voice and Video

   With XEP-0166 [XEP-0166] the ability to initiate and manage peer-to-
   peer media sessions between two XMPP entities in a way that is
   interoperable with existing Internet standards had been defined.  The
   protocol enables the core session management semantics (compatible
   with SIP) to be used for a wide variety of application types (e.g.,
   voice chat, video chat).

   The ability for voice and video conference bridge as needed by
   persons with disabilities for sign-language interpretation is,
   however, not offered by Jingle.

4.5.  Real-Time Text

   RFC 5194 [RFC5194] defines the framework for Real-Time Text over IP.
   All required functionality is based on SIP and the Real-Time
   Transport Protocol (RTP).

   XEP-0301 [XEP-0301] seems to offer functionality that is semantically
   equivalent to what had been defined by RFC 5194.

4.6.  PSAP Callback

   After an emergency call is completed it is possible that the call-
   taker feels the need for further communication.  For example, the
   call may have been dropped by accident without the call- taker having
   sufficient information about the current situation of a wounded
   person.  A call-taker may trigger a callback towards the emergency
   caller using the contact informationprovided with the initial
   emergency call, which includes the GRUU as well as the Address-of-
   Record.  This callback would be treated like any other call and as a
   consequence it may get blocked by authorization policies or may get
   forwarded to an answering machine.

   The work on PSAP callback [I-D.ietf-ecrit-psap-callback] is an
   ongoing effort to give these calls preferential treatment so that the

Internet-Draft           XMPP Emergency Services              March 2012


   callback has a higher success in reaching the original emergency
   call.

   This functionality does not exist for XMPP yet.

4.7.  Additional Data

   The Internet Protocol suite offers a rich information exchange and
   thereby better situational awareness for call takers and first
   responders.  The richness comes in various forms, including the
   multi-media communication capabilities (via voice, video, instant
   messaging, and real-time text), but also via more additional data
   made available by various actors of the emergency signaling chain.
   Sharing information between various actors will enable more
   intelligent decision making and therefore better response in case of
   an emergency.

   In the SIP environment additional data had been provided in various
   ways, as described in [I-D.ietf-ecrit-additional-data], and the same
   capabilities will have to be provided in XMPP as well.

4.8.  Data Only Emergency Calls

   Data-only emergency calls are similar to regular emergency calls in
   the sense that they require emergency call routing functionality and
   may even have the same location requirements.  On the other hand, the
   communication interaction occurs without establishment of a voice or
   video channel.

   As a technical mechanism a Common Alert Protocol (CAP) payload is
   pushed by the SIP User Agent towards the PSAP, as described in
   [I-D.ietf-ecrit-data-only-ea].  The ability to push CAP payloads is
   also available in XMPP with XEP-0127 [XEP-0127].

5.  Security Considerations

   This document focuses on the integration of emergency services
   functionality into XMPP.  Offering security features for emergency
   calls is both important but also challenging as security failures
   (such as expired certificates) may have fatal effects.  SIP offers a
   secure identity mechanism as well as media security.  Functionality
   for these two areas are specified in [I-D.ietf-ecrit-phonebcp].
   Offering a solid mechanisms for identification of the persons seeking
   help is important for the overal security of the emergency services
   system, as described in [I-D.ietf-ecrit-trustworthy-location].
