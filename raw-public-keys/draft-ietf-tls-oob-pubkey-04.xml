    <abstract>
      <t>
         This document specifies a new TLS certificate type for exchanging
         raw public keys in Transport Layer Security (TLS)
         and Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) for use with out-of-band
         public key validation. Currently, TLS authentication can only occur via X.509-based Public
Key Infrastructure (PKI) or OpenPGP certificates. By specifying a minimum resource for raw
         public key exchange, implementations can use alternative public key validation
         methods.
      </t>
      <t>
         One such alternative public key valiation method is offered by the DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) together with DNS Security. Another alternative is to utilize pre-configured keys, as is the case with sensors and other
         embedded devices. The usage of raw public keys, instead of X.509-based certificates, leads to a smaller 
         code footprint. 
      </t>

      <t>The support for raw public keys is introduced into TLS via a new non-PKIX certificate type.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

   <middle>
    <section anchor="into" title="Introduction">
       <t>Traditionally, TLS server public keys are obtained in PKIX containers
          in-band using the TLS handshake and validated using trust anchors
          based on a  <xref target='PKIX'/> certification authority (CA). This
          method can add a complicated trust relationship that is difficult
          to validate. Examples of such complexity can be seen in
          <xref target='Defeating-SSL'/>.</t>

       <t>Alternative methods are available that allow a TLS client to obtain
          the TLS server public key:</t>

       <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>The TLS server public key is obtained from a DNSSEC secured resource records              
             using DANE <xref target="I-D.ietf-dane-protocol"/>.</t>

          <t>The TLS server public key is obtained from a <xref target='PKIX'/>
             certificate chain from an Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) <xref target="LDAP"/> server.</t>

          <t>The TLS client and server public key is provisioned into the operating system firmware image,
             and updated via software updates.</t>

          </list>
       </t>

       <t>Some smart objects use the UDP-based Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) <xref target="I-D.ietf-core-coap"/> to
	      interact with a Web server to upload sensor data at a regular intervals, such as
          temperature readings. CoAP <xref target="I-D.ietf-core-coap"/> can utilize
          DTLS for securing the client-to-server communication. As part of the manufacturing process,
          the embeded device may be configured with the address and the public key of a
          dedicated CoAP server, as well as a public key for the client itself. 
		  The usage of X.509-based PKIX certificates <xref target='PKIX'/> does not suit all 
		  smart object deployments and would therefore be an unneccesarry burden.
       </t>
	   
	   <t>The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.2 <xref target="RFC5246"/> provides
         a framework for extensions to TLS as well as guidelines for
         designing such extensions. This document defines an extension to indicate the support for raw public keys.

	<section title="The 'raw-public-key' Extension"> 
	
	<section title="Client Hello">

   <t>In order to indicate the support of multiple certificate types,
   clients MUST include an extension of type 'raw-public-key' to the extended
   client hello message.  The 'raw-public-key' TLS extension is assigned the
   value of [[TBD]] from the TLS ExtensionType registry.  This value is used
   as the extension number for the extensions in both the client hello
   message and the server hello message.  The hello extension mechanism
   is described in <xref target="RFC5246"/>.</t>

   <t>This extension carries a list of supported certificate types the
   client can use, sorted by client preference.  This extension MUST be
   omitted if the client only supports X.509 certificates.  The
   "extension_data" field of this extension contains an
   ExtensionType structure.  Note that the
   ExtensionType structure is being used both by the client
   and the server, even though the structure is only specified once in
   this document.  Reusing a single specification for both client and
   server is common in other specifications, such as the TLS protocol
   itself <xref target="RFC5246"/>.</t>

   <t>If the server receives a client hello that contains the 'raw-public-key'
   extension and chooses a cipher suite that requires a certificate,
   then two outcomes are possible.  The server MUST either select a

   client hello or terminate the session with a fatal alert of type
   "unsupported_certificate".</t>

   <t>The certificate type selected by the server is encoded in a
   CertificateTypeExtension structure, which is included in the extended

   in the 'raw-public-key' extension allows the client to provide an

  <section title="Client Hello">

   <t>
   In order to indicate the support of out-of-band raw public keys,
   clients MUST include an extension of type 'raw-public-key' to the extended
   client hello message.  The 'raw-public-key' TLS extension, which is defined
   in <xref target="RFC6091"/>, is assigned the
   value of 9 from the TLS ExtensionType registry.  This value is used
   as the extension number for the extensions in both the client hello
   message and the server hello message.  The hello extension mechanism
   is described in <xref target="RFC5246"/>.
   </t>

   <t>
   The 'raw-public-key' TLS extension carries a list of supported raw public key extension types the
   client can use, sorted by client preference. The value zero (0) is defined for use with this specification. 
   Future documents may define additional raw public key types that require addition values to be registered. The
   "extension_data" field of this extension contains a
   CertificateTypeExtension structure.  Note that the
   CertificateTypeExtension structure is being used both by the client
   and the server, even though the structure is only specified once in

    <section title="Security Considerations" anchor="security">

	<t>The transmission of raw public keys, as described in this document, 
	provides benefits by lowering the over-the-air transmission overhead since 
	raw public keys are quite naturally smaller than an entire certificate. 
	There are also advantages from a codesize point of view for parsing and
    processing these keys. The crytographic procedures for assocating the 
	public key with the possession of a private key also follows standard 
	procedures.</t>

    <t>The main security challenge is, however, how to associate the public 
    key with a specific entity. This information will be needed to make 
    authorization decisions. Without a secure binding, man-in-the-middle 
    attacks may be the consequence. This document assumes that such 
	binding can be made out-of-band and we list a few examples in <xref target="into"/>. 
	DANE <xref target="I-D.ietf-dane-protocol"/> offers one such approach. 
	If public keys are obtained using DANE, these public keys are authenticated via DNSSEC.
	Pre-configured keys is another out of band method for authenticating raw public keys.
	 While pre-configured keys are not suitable for 
	a generic Web-based e-commerce environment such keys are a reasonable approach
	for many smart object deployments where there is a close relationship between 
	the software running on the device and the server-side communication endpoint. 
	Regardless of the chosen mechanism for out-of-band public key validation an 
	assessment of the most suitable approach has to be made prior to the start of a 
	deployment to ensure the security of the system.</t>

         <t>This document describes the protocol elements, along with
         their semantics and encodings, of the Lightweight Directory
         Access Protocol (LDAP).  LDAP provides access to distributed
         directory services that act in accordance with X.500 data
         and service models.  These protocol elements are based
         on those described in the X.500 Directory Access Protocol
         (DAP). [STANDARDS TRACK]</t>
