1.  Introduction

   Traditionally, TLS client and server public keys are obtained in PKIX
   containers in-band using the TLS handshake and validated using trust
   anchors based on a [PKIX] certification authority (CA).  This method
   can add a complicated trust relationship that is difficult to
   validate.  Examples of such complexity can be seen in
   [Defeating-SSL].

   Alternative methods are available that allow a TLS clients/servers to
   obtain the TLS servers/client public key:

   o  TLS clients can obtain the TLS server public key from a DNSSEC
      secured resource records using DANE [RFC6698].

   o  The TLS client or server public key is obtained from a [PKIX]
      certificate chain from an Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
      (LDAP) [LDAP] server or web page.

Internet-Draft        TLS OOB Public Key Validation            July 2013


   o  The TLS client and server public key is provisioned into the
      operating system firmware image, and updated via software updates.
      For example:

      Some smart objects use the UDP-based Constrained Application
      Protocol (CoAP) [I-D.ietf-core-coap] to interact with a Web server
      to upload sensor data at a regular intervals, such as temperature
      readings.  CoAP [I-D.ietf-core-coap] can utilize DTLS for securing
      the client-to-server communication.  As part of the manufacturing
      process, the embedded device may be configured with the address
      and the public key of a dedicated CoAP server, as well as a public
      key for the client itself.

   The mechanism defined herein only provides authentication when an
   out-of-band mechanism is also used to bind the public key to the
   entity presenting the key.

   This document registers a new value to the IANA certificate types
   registry for the support of raw public keys.  It also defines two new
   TLS extensions, "client_certificate_type" and
   "server_certificate_type".

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  New TLS Extension

   This section describes the changes to the TLS handshake message
   contents when raw public keys are to be used.  Figure 4 illustrates
   the exchange of messages as described in the sub-sections below.  The
   client and the server exchange make use of two new TLS extensions,
   namely 'client_certificate_type' and 'server_certificate_type', and
   an already available IANA TLS Certificate Type registry
   [TLS-Certificate-Types-Registry] to indicate their ability and desire
   to exchange raw public keys.  These raw public keys, in the form of a
   SubjectPublicKeyInfo structure, are then carried inside the
   Certificate payload.  The Certificate and the SubjectPublicKeyInfo
   structure is shown in Figure 1.


   opaque ASN.1Cert<1..2^24-1>;

   struct {
       select(certificate_type){

           // certificate type defined in this document.
           case RawPublicKey:
             opaque ASN.1_subjectPublicKeyInfo<1..2^24-1>;

           // X.509 certificate defined in RFC 5246
           case X.509:
             ASN.1Cert certificate_list<0..2^24-1>;

           // Additional certificate type based on TLS
           // Certificate Type Registry
       };
   } Certificate;


                   Figure 1: TLS Certificate Structure.

   The SubjectPublicKeyInfo structure is defined in Section 4.1 of RFC
   5280 [PKIX] and does not only contain the raw keys, such as the
   public exponent and the modulus of an RSA public key, but also an
   algorithm identifier.  The algorithm identifier can also include
   parameters.  The structure, as shown in Figure 2, is encoded in an
   DER encoded ASN.1 format [X.690] and therefore contains length
   information as well.  An example is provided in Appendix A.


      SubjectPublicKeyInfo  ::=  SEQUENCE  {
           algorithm               AlgorithmIdentifier,
           subjectPublicKey        BIT STRING  }

      AlgorithmIdentifier   ::=  SEQUENCE  {
           algorithm               OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
           parameters              ANY DEFINED BY algorithm OPTIONAL  }


              Figure 2: SubjectPublicKeyInfo ASN.1 Structure.

   The algorithm identifiers are Object Identifiers (OIDs).  RFC 3279
   [RFC3279] and [RFC5480], for example, define the following OIDs shown
   in Figure 3.  Note that this list is not exhaustive and more OIDs may
   be defined in future RFCs.  RFC 5480 also defines a number of OIDs.

   The semantic of the two extensions is defined as follows:

      The 'client_certificate_type' and 'server_certificate_type' sent
      in the client hello, may carry a list of supported certificate
      types, sorted by client preference.  It is a list in the case
      where the client supports multiple certificate types.  These
      extension MUST be omitted if the client only supports X.509
      certificates.  The 'client_certificate_type' sent in the client
      hello indicates the certificate types the client is able to

      provide to the server, when requested using a certificate_request
      message.  The 'server_certificate_type' in the client hello
      indicates the type of certificates the client is able to process
      when provided by the server in a subsequent certificate payload.

      The 'client_certificate_type' returned in the server hello
      indicates the certificate type found in the attached certificate
      payload.  Only a single value is permitted.  The
      'server_certificate_type' in the server hello indicates the type
      of certificates the client is requested to provide in a subsequent
      certificate payload.  The value conveyed in the
      'server_certificate_type' MUST be selected from one of the values
      provided in the 'server_certificate_type' sent in the client
      hello.  If the server does not send a certificate_request payload
      or none of the certificates supported by the client (as indicated
      in the 'server_certificate_type' in the client hello) match the
      server-supported certificate types the 'server_certificate_type'
      payload sent in the server hello is omitted.

   The "extension_data" field of this extension contains the
   ClientCertTypeExtension or the ServerCertTypeExtension structure, as
   shown in Figure 5.  The CertificateType structure is an enum with
   with values from TLS Certificate Type Registry.

           select(ClientOrServerExtension)
               case client:

               case server:
                 CertificateType server_certificate_type;
           }
   } ServerCertTypeExtension;

   No new cipher suites are required to use raw public keys.  All
   existing cipher suites that support a key exchange method compatible
   with the defined extension can be used.

4.  TLS Handshake Extension

4.1.  Client Hello

   In order to indicate the support of out-of-band raw public keys,
   clients MUST include the 'client_certificate_type' and
   'server_certificate_type' extensions in an extended client hello
   message.  The hello extension mechanism is described in TLS 1.2
   [RFC5246].

4.2.  Server Hello

   If the server receives a client hello that contains the
   'client_certificate_type' and 'server_certificate_type' extensions
   and chooses a cipher suite then three outcomes are possible:

   1.  The server does not support the extension defined in this
       document.  In this case the server returns the server hello
       without the extensions defined in this document.

   2.  The server supports the extension defined in this document and
       has at least one certificate type in common with the client.  In
       this case it returns the 'server_certificate_type' and indicates
       the selected certificate type value.

   3.  The server supports the extension defined in this document but
       does not have a certificate type in common with the client.  In
       this case the server terminate the session with a fatal alert of
       type "unsupported_certificate".

   If the TLS server also requests a certificate from the client (via
   the certificate_request) it MUST include the
   'client_certificate_type' extension with a value chosen from the list
   of client-supported certificates types (as provided in the
   'client_certificate_type' of the client hello).

   If the client hello indicates support of raw public keys in the
   'client_certificate_type' extension and the server chooses to use raw
   public keys then the TLS server MUST place the SubjectPublicKeyInfo
   structure into the Certificate payload.

4.3.  Certificate Request

Internet-Draft        TLS OOB Public Key Validation            July 2013


   The semantics of this message remain the same as in the TLS
   specification.

4.4.  Other Handshake Messages

   All the other handshake messages are identical to the TLS
   specification.

4.5.  Client authentication

   Client authentication by the TLS server is supported only through
   authentication of the received client SubjectPublicKeyInfo via an
   out-of-band method.

5.  Examples

   Figure 6, Figure 7, and Figure 8 illustrate example exchanges.

   The first example shows an exchange where the TLS client indicates
   its ability to receive and validate raw public keys from the server.
   In our example the client is quite restricted since it is unable to
   process other certificate types sent by the server.  It also does not
   have credentials (at the TLS layer) it could send.  The
   'client_certificate_type' extension indicates this in [1].  When the
   TLS server receives the client hello it processes the
   'client_certificate_type' extension.  Since it also has a raw public
   key it indicates in [2] that it had chosen to place the
   SubjectPublicKeyInfo structure into the Certificate payload [3].  The
   client uses this raw public key in the TLS handshake and an out-of-
   band technique, such as DANE, to verify its validity.


   client_hello,
   server_certificate_type=(RawPublicKey) -> // [1]

                            <-  server_hello,
                                server_certificate_type=(RawPublicKey), // [2]
                                certificate, // [3]
                                server_key_exchange,

   Application Data        <------->     Application Data


     Figure 6: Example with Raw Public Key provided by the TLS Server

   In our second example the TLS client as well as the TLS server use
   raw public keys.  This is a use case envisioned for smart object
   networking.  The TLS client in this case is an embedded device that
   is configured with a raw public key for use with TLS and is also able
   to process raw public keys sent by the server.  Therefore, it
   indicates these capabilities in [1].  As in the previously shown
   example the server fulfills the client's request, indicates this via
   the "RawPublicKey" value in the server_certificate_type payload, and
   provides a raw public key into the Certificate payload back to the
   client (see [3]).  The TLS server, however, demands client
   authentication and therefore a certificate_request is added [4].  The
   certificate_type payload in [2] indicates that the TLS server accepts
   raw public keys.  The TLS client, who has a raw public key pre-
   provisioned, returns it in the Certificate payload [5] to the server.


   client_hello,
   client_certificate_type=(RawPublicKey) // [1]
   server_certificate_type=(RawPublicKey) // [1]
                            ->
                            <-  server_hello,
                                server_certificate_type=(RawPublicKey)//[2]
                                certificate, // [3]
                                client_certificate_type=(RawPublicKey)//[4]
                                certificate_request, // [4]

   In our last example we illustrate a combination of raw public key and
   X.509 usage.  The client uses a raw public key for client
   authentication but the server provides an X.509 certificate.  This
   exchange starts with the client indicating its ability to process
   X.509 certificates provided by the server, and the ability to send
   raw public keys (see [1]).  The server provides the X.509 certificate
   in [3] with the indication present in [2].  For client authentication
   the server indicates in [4] that it selected the raw public key
   format and requests a certificate from the client in [5].  The TLS
   client provides a raw public key in [6] after receiving and

6.  Security Considerations

   The transmission of raw public keys, as described in this document,
   provides benefits by lowering the over-the-air transmission overhead
   since raw public keys are quite naturally smaller than an entire
   certificate.  There are also advantages from a code size point of
   view for parsing and processing these keys.  The cryptographic
   procedures for associating the public key with the possession of a
   private key also follows standard procedures.

Internet-Draft        TLS OOB Public Key Validation            July 2013


   The main security challenge is, however, how to associate the public
   key with a specific entity.  Without a secure binding between
   identity and key the protocol will be vulnerable to masquerade and
   man-in-the-middle attacks.  This document assumes that such binding
   can be made out-of-band and we list a few examples in Section 1.
   DANE [RFC6698] offers one such approach.  In order to address these
   vulnerabilities, specifications that make use of the extension MUST
   specify how the identity and public key are bound.  If public keys
   are obtained using DANE, these public keys are authenticated via
   DNSSEC.  Pre-configured keys is another out of band method for
   authenticating raw public keys.  While pre-configured keys are not
   suitable for a generic Web-based e-commerce environment such keys are
   a reasonable approach for many smart object deployments where there
   is a close relationship between the software running on the device
   and the server-side communication endpoint.  Regardless of the chosen
   mechanism for out-of-band public key validation an assessment of the
   most suitable approach has to be made prior to the start of a
   deployment to ensure the security of the system.

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is asked to register a new value in the "TLS Certificate Types"
   registry of Transport Layer Security (TLS) Extensions
   [TLS-Certificate-Types-Registry], as follows:


   Value: 2
   Description: Raw Public Key
   Reference: [[THIS RFC]]



   This document asks IANA to allocate two new TLS extensions,
   "client_certificate_type" and "server_certificate_type", from the TLS
   ExtensionType registry defined in [RFC5246].  These extensions are
   used in both the client hello message and the server hello message.
   The new extension type is used for certificate type negotiation.  The
   values carried in these extensions are taken from the TLS Certificate
   Types registry [TLS-Certificate-Types-Registry].

8.  Acknowledgements

   The feedback from the TLS working group meeting at IETF#81 has
   substantially shaped the document and we would like to thank the
   meeting participants for their input.  The support for hashes of
   public keys has been moved to [I-D.ietf-tls-cached-info] after the
   discussions at the IETF#82 meeting.
