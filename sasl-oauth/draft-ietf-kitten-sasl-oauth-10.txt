             A set of SASL and GSS-API Mechanisms for OAuth
                  draft-ietf-kitten-sasl-oauth-10.txt

Abstract

   OAuth enables a third-party application to obtain limited access to a
   protected resource, either on behalf of a resource owner by
   orchestrating an approval interaction, or by allowing the third-party
   application to obtain access on its own behalf.

   This document defines how an application client uses credentials
   obtained via OAuth over the Simple Authentication and Security Layer
   (SASL) or the Generic Security Service Application Program Interface
   (GSS-API) to access a protected resource at a resource serve.
   Thereby, it enables schemes defined within the OAuth framework for
   non-HTTP-based application protocols.

   Clients typically store the user's long-term credential.  This does,
   however, lead to significant security vulnerabilities, for example,
   when such a credential leaks.  A significant benefit of OAuth for
   usage in those clients is that the password is replaced by a token.
   Tokens typically provided limited access rights and can be managed
   and revoked separately from the user's long-term credential
   (password).

Internet-Draft      SASL/GSS-API Mechanisms for OAuth      February 2013


1.  Introduction

   OAuth 1.0a [RFC5849] and OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749] are protocol frameworks
   that enable a third-party application to obtain limited access to a
   protected resource, either on behalf of a resource owner by
   orchestrating an approval interaction, or by allowing the third-party
   application to obtain access on its own behalf.

   The core OAuth 2.0 specification [RFC6749] does not define the
   interaction between the OAuth client and the resource server for the
   access to a protected resource using an Access Token.  Instead, this
   functionality is described in separate specifications, such as the
   bearer token specification [RFC6750].  OAuth 1.0a included the
   communication between the OAuth client and the resource server in
   [RFC5849].

   The main use cases for OAuth 2.0 and OAuth 1.0a have so far focused
   on an HTTP-based environment only.  This document integrates OAuth
   1.0a and OAuth 2.0 into non-HTTP-based applications using the
   integration into SASL and the GSS-API.  Hence, this document takes
   advantage of the OAuth protocol and its deployment base to provide a
   way to use SASL [RFC4422] and the GSS-API [RFC2743] to gain access to
   resources when using non-HTTP-based protocols, such as the Internet
   Message Access Protocol (IMAP) [RFC3501] and SMTP [RFC5321], which is
   what this memo uses in the examples.

   To illustrate the impact of integrating this specification into an
   OAuth-enabled application environment Figure 1 shows the abstract
   message flow of OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749].  As indicated in the figure,
   this document impacts the exchange of messages (E) and (F) since SASL
   or the GSS-API is used for interaction between the client and the
   resource server instead of HTTP.

                     Figure 1: OAuth 2.0 Protocol Flow

   The Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) is a framework
   for providing authentication and data security services in
   connection-oriented protocols via replaceable mechanisms.  It
   provides a structured interface between protocols and mechanisms.
   The resulting framework allows new protocols to reuse existing
   mechanisms and allows old protocols to make use of new mechanisms.
   The framework also provides a protocol for securing subsequent
   protocol exchanges within a data security layer.

   The Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API)
   [RFC2743] provides a framework for applications to support multiple
   authentication mechanisms through a unified interface.

   This document defines SASL mechanisms for OAuth, and it conforms to
   the new bridge between SASL and the GSS-API called GS2 [RFC5801].
   This means that this document defines both SASL and GSS-API
   mechanisms.  Implementers may be interested in either the SASL, the
   GSS-API, or even both mechanisms.  To facilitate these two variants,
   the description has been split into two parts, one part that provides
   normative references for those interested in the SASL OAuth mechanism
   (see Section 3), and a second part for those implementers that wish
   to implement the GSS-API portion (see Section 4).

Internet-Draft      SASL/GSS-API Mechanisms for OAuth      February 2013


   When OAuth is integrated into SASL and the GSS-API the high-level
   steps are as follows:

      (A) The client requests authorization from the resource owner.
      The authorization request can be made directly to the resource
      owner (as shown), or preferably indirectly via the authorization
      server as an intermediary.

      (B) The client receives an authorization grant which is a
      credential representing the resource owner's authorization,
      expressed using one of four grant types defined in this
      specification or using an extension grant type.  The authorization
      grant type depends on the method used by the client to request
      authorization and the types supported by the authorization server.

      (C) The client requests an access token by authenticating with the
      authorization server and presenting the authorization grant.

      (D) The authorization server authenticates the client and
      validates the authorization grant, and if valid issues an access
      token.

      (E) The client requests the protected resource from the resource
      server and authenticates by presenting the access token.

      (F) The resource server validates the access token, and if valid,
      indicates a successful authentication.

   Again, steps (E) and (F) are not defined in [RFC6749] (but are
   described in [RFC6750] instead) and are the main functionality
   specified within this document.  Consequently, the message exchange
   shown in Figure 1 is the result of this specification.  The client
   will generally need to determine the authentication endpoints (and
   perhaps the service endpoints) before the OAuth 2.0 protocol exchange
   messages in steps (A)-(D) are executed.  The discovery of the
   resource owner and authorization server endpoints is outside the
   scope of this specification.  The client must discover those
   endpoints using a discovery mechanisms, such as Webfinger using host-
   meta [I-D.ietf-appsawg-webfinger].  In band discovery is not tenable
   if clients support the OAuth 2.0 password grant.  Once credentials
   are obtained the client proceeds to steps (E) and (F) defined in this
   specification.

   OAuth 1.0 follows a similar model but uses a different terminology
   and does not separate the resource server from the authorization
   server.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The reader is assumed to be familiar with the terms used in the OAuth
   2.0 specification [RFC6749].

   In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and
   server respectively.  Line breaks have been inserted for readability.

   Note that the IMAP SASL specification requires base64 encoding, see
   Section 4 of [RFC4648], not this memo.

3.  OAuth SASL Mechanism Specifications

   SASL is used as an authentication framework in a variety of
   application layer protocols.  This document defines the following
   SASL mechanisms for usage with OAuth:



      OAUTHBEARER:  OAuth 2.0 bearer tokens, as described in [RFC6750].
         RFC 6750 uses Transport Layer Security (TLS) to secure the
         protocol interaction between the client and the resource
         server.

      OAUTH10A:  OAuth 1.0a MAC tokens (using the HMAC-SHA1 keyed
         message digest), as described in Section 3.4.2 of [RFC5849].

      OAUTH10A-PLUS:  Adds channel binding [RFC5056] capability to
         OAUTH10A for protection against man-in-the-middle attacks.
         OAUTH10A-PLUS mandates the usage of Transport Layer Security
         (TLS).

   New extensions may be defined to add additional OAuth Access Token
   Types.  Such a new SASL OAuth mechanism can be added by simply
   registering the new name(s) and citing this specification for the
   further definition.  New channel binding enabled "-PLUS" mechanisms
   defined in this way MUST include message integrity protection.  A
   newly defined mechanism would also need to register a new GS2 OID.

   These mechanisms are client initiated and lock-step, the server
   always replying to a client message.  In the case where the client
   has and correctly uses a valid token the flow is:

   o  Client sends a valid and correct initial client response.

   o  Server responds with a successful authentication.

   In the case where authorization fails the server sends an error
   result, then client MUST then send an additional message to the
   server in order to allow the server to finish the exchange.  Some
   protocols and common SASL implementations do not support both sending
   a SASL message and finalizing a SASL negotiation, the additional
   client message in the error case deals with this problem.  This
   exchange is:

   o  Client sends an invalid initial client response.

   o  Server responds with an error message.

Internet-Draft      SASL/GSS-API Mechanisms for OAuth      February 2013


   o  Client sends a dummy client response.

   o  Server fails the authentication.

3.1.  Initial Client Response

   Client responses are a key/value pair sequence.  The initial client
   response includes a gs2-header as defined in GS2 [RFC5801], which
   carries the authorization ID.  These key/value pairs carry the
   equivalent values from an HTTP context in order to be able to
   complete an OAuth style HTTP authorization.  Unknown key/value pairs
   MUST be ignored by the server.  The ABNF [RFC5234] syntax is:



     kvsep          = %x01
     key            = 1*ALPHA
     value          = *(VCHAR / SP / HTAB / CR / LF )
     kvpair         = key "=" value kvsep
     client_resp    = 0*kvpair kvsep
     ;; gs2-header  = As defined in GSS-API
     initial_client_resp = gs2-header kvsep client_resp

   The following key/value pairs are defined in the client response:



      auth (REQUIRED):  The payload of the HTTP Authorization header for
         an equivalent HTTP OAuth authorization.

      host:  Contains the host name to which the client connected.

      port:  Contains the port number represented as a decimal positive
         integer string without leading zeros to which the client
         connected.

      qs:  The HTTP query string.  In non-channel binding mechanisms
         this is reserved, the client SHOUD NOT send it, and has the
         default value of "".  In "-PLUS" variants this carries a single
         key value pair "cbdata" for the channel binding data payload
         formatted as an HTTP query string.

   For OAuth Access Token Types that use keyed message digests the
   client MUST send host and port number key/values, and the server MUST
   fail an authorization request requiring keyed message digests that do
   not have host and port values.  In OAuth 1.0a for example, the so-
   called "signature base string calculation" includes the reconstructed
   HTTP URL.

Internet-Draft      SASL/GSS-API Mechanisms for OAuth      February 2013


3.1.1.  Reserved Key/Values

   In these mechanisms values for path, query string and post body are
   assigned default values.  OAuth authorization schemes MAY define
   usage of these in the SASL context and extend this specification.
   For OAuth Access Token Types that use request keyed message digest
   the default values MUST be used unless explicit values are provided
   in the client response.  The following key values are reserved for
   future use:



      mthd (RESERVED):  HTTP method, the default value is "POST".

      path (RESERVED):  HTTP path data, the default value is "/".

      post (RESERVED):  HTTP post data, the default value is "".

3.1.2.  Use of the gs2-header

   The OAuth scheme related mechanisms are also GSS-API mechanisms, see
   Section 4 for further detail.  The gs2-header is used as follows:

   o  The "gs2-nonstd-flag" MUST NOT be present.

   o  The "gs2-authzid" carries the authorization identity as specified
      in [RFC5801].  If present the application MUST determine whether
      access is granted for the identity asserted in the OAuth
      credential, if it does not the server MUST fail the negotiation.

   In the non "-PLUS" mechanisms the "gs2-cb-flag" MUST be set to "n"
   because channel-binding [RFC5056] data is not expected.  In the
   OAUTH10A-PLUS mechanism (or other -PLUS variants based on this
   specification) the "gs2-cb-flag" MUST be set appropriately by the
   client.

3.2.  Server's Response

   The server validates the response per the specification for the OAuth
   Access Token Types used.  If the OAuth Access Token Type utilizes a
   keyed message digest of the request parameters then the client must
   provide a client response that satisfies the data requirements for
   the scheme in use.

   In a "-PLUS" mechanism the server examines the channel binding data,
   extracts the channel binding unique prefix, and extracts the raw
   channel biding data based on the channel binding type used.  It then
   computes it's own copy of the channel binding payload and compares

Internet-Draft      SASL/GSS-API Mechanisms for OAuth      February 2013


   that to the payload sent by the client in the cbdata key/value.
   Those two must be equal for channel binding to succeed.

   The server responds to a successfully verified client message by
   completing the SASL negotiation.  The authenticated identity reported
   by the SASL mechanism is the identity securely established for the
   client with the OAuth credential.  The application, not the SASL
   mechanism, based on local access policy determines whether the
   identity reported by the mechanism is allowed access to the requested
   resource.  Note that the semantics of the authz-id is specified by
   the SASL framework [RFC4422].

3.2.1.  OAuth Identifiers in the SASL Context

   In the OAuth framework the client may be authenticated by the
   authorization server and the resource owner is authenticated to the
   authorization server.  OAuth access tokens may contain information
   about the authentication of the resource owner and about the client
   and may therefore make this information accessible to the resource
   server.

   If both identifiers are needed by an application the developer will
   need to provide a way to communicate that from the SASL mechanism
   back to the application, such as a GSS-API [RFC2743] named type like
   GSS_C_NT_USER_NAME or a comparable newly defined GSS-API name type or
   name attribute [RFC6680].

3.2.2.  Server Response to Failed Authentication

   For a failed authentication the server returns a JSON [RFC4627]
   formatted error result, and fails the authentication.  The error
   result consists of the following values:



      status (REQUIRED):  The authorization error code.  Valid error
         codes are defined in the IANA [[need registry name]] registry
         specified in the OAuth 2 core specification.

      scope (OPTIONAL):  An OAuth scope which is valid to access the
         service.  This may be empty which implies that unscoped tokens
         are required, or a space separated list.  Use of a space
         separated list is NOT RECOMMENDED.

   If the resource server provides a scope then the client MUST always
   request scoped tokens from the token endpoint.  If the resource
   server provides no scope to the client then the client SHOULD presume
   an empty scope (unscoped token) is needed.

   If channel binding is in use and the channel binding fails the server
   responds with a status code set to 412 to indicate that the channel
   binding precondition failed.  If the authentication scheme in use
   does not include signing the server SHOULD revoke the presented
   credential and the client SHOULD discard that credential.

3.2.3.  Completing an Error Message Sequence

   Section 3.6 of [RFC4422] explicitly prohibits additional information
   in an unsuccessful authentication outcome.  Therefore, the error
   message is sent in a normal message.  The client MUST then send an
   additional client response consisting of a single %x01 (control A)
   character to the server in order to allow the server to finish the
   exchange.

3.3.  OAuth Access Token Types using Keyed Message Digests

   OAuth Access Token Types may use keyed message digests and the client
   and the resource server may need to perform a cryptographic
   computation for integrity protection and data origin authentication.

   OAuth is designed for access to resources identified by URIs.  SASL
   is designed for user authentication, and has no facility for more
   fine-grained access control.  In this specification we require or
   define default values for the data elements from an HTTP request
   which allow the signature base string to be constructed properly.
   The default HTTP path is "/" and the default post body is empty.
   These atoms are defined as extension points so that no changes are
   needed if there is a revision of SASL which supports more specific
   resource authorization, e.g., IMAP access to a specific folder or FTP
   access limited to a specific directory.

   Using the example in the OAuth 1.0a specification as a starting
   point, on an IMAP server running on port 143 and given the OAuth 1.0a
   style authorization request (with %x01 shown as ^A and line breaks
   added for readability) below:


   n,a=user@example.com^A
   host=example.com^A
   user=user@example.com^A
   port=143^A
   auth=OAuth realm="Example",
              oauth_consumer_key="9djdj82h48djs9d2",
              oauth_token="kkk9d7dh3k39sjv7",
              oauth_signature_method="HMAC-SHA1",
              oauth_timestamp="137131201",
              oauth_nonce="7d8f3e4a",

              oauth_signature="Tm90IGEgcmVhbCBzaWduYXR1cmU%3D"^A^A

   The signature base string would be constructed per the OAuth 1.0
   specification [RFC5849] with the following things noted:

   o  The method value is defaulted to POST.

   o  The scheme defaults to be "http", and any port number other than
      80 is included.

   o  The path defaults to "/".

   o  The query string defaults to "".

   In this example the signature base string with line breaks added for
   readability would be:


   POST&http%3A%2F%2Fexample.com:143%2F&oauth_consumer_key%3D9djdj82h4
   8djs9d2%26oauth_nonce%3D7d8f3e4a%26oauth_signature_method%3DHMAC-SH
   A1%26oauth_timestamp%3D137131201%26oauth_token%3Dkkk9d7dh3k39sjv7

3.4.  Channel Binding

   The channel binding data is carried in the "qs" (query string) key
   value pair formatted as a standard HTTP query parameter with the name
   "cbdata".  Channel binding requires that the channel binding data be
   integrity protected end-to-end in order to protect against man-in-
   the-middle attacks.  All SASL OAuth mechanisms with a "-PLUS" postfix
   MUST provide integrity protection.  It should be noted that while the
   Bearer Access Token Type mandates TLS it does not create keying
   material at the application layer and is not suitable for use with
   channel bindings.

   The channel binding data is computed by the client based on it's
   choice of preferred channel binding type.  As specified in [RFC5056],
   the channel binding information MUST start with the channel binding
   unique prefix, followed by a colon (ASCII 0x3A), followed by a base64
   encoded channel binding payload.  The channel binding payload is the
   raw data from the channel binding type.  For example, if the client
   is using tls-unique for channel binding then the raw channel binding
   data is the TLS finished message as specified in Section 3.1 of
   [RFC5929].

4.  GSS-API OAuth Mechanism Specification

   Note: The normative references in this section are informational for
   SASL implementers, but they are normative for GSS-API implementers.

   A SASL OAuth mechanism is also a GSS-API mechanism and the messages
   described in Section 3 are the same with the following changes to the
   GS2 related elements:

   1.  the GS2 header on the client's first message is excluded when
       used as a GSS-API mechanism.

   2.  the initial context token header is prefixed to the client's
       first authentication message (context token), as described in
       Section 3.1 of RFC 2743 [RFC2743],

   The GSS-API mechanism OIDs are:

   o  OAUTHBEARER: [[TBD: IANA -- probably in the 1.3.6.1.5.5 tree]]

   o  OAUTH10A: [[TBD: IANA -- probably in the 1.3.6.1.5.5 tree]]

   o  OAUTH10A-PLUS: [[TBD: IANA -- probably in the 1.3.6.1.5.5 tree]]

   The setting of the security context flags depends on the selected
   mechanism:

   o  OAUTHBEARER: The mutual_state flag (GSS_C_MUTUAL_FLAG) MUST be set
      to TRUE since server authentication.  Server-side authentication
      is accomplished via the mandatory use of TLS by the OAUTHBEARER
      mechanism.

   o  OAUTH10A: The mutual_state flag (GSS_C_MUTUAL_FLAG) MUST be set to
      FALSE since server authentication.  This mechanism does not
      provide server-side authentication.  Since the TLS channel is
      managed by the application outside of the GSS-API mechanism
      (unlike in the other two OAuth mechanisms specified in this
      document), the OAUTH10A mechanism itself is unable to confirm the
      name while the application is able to perform this comparison for
      the mechanism.  For this reason, applications MUST match the TLS
      server identity with the target name using the appropriate
      application profile, as discussed in [RFC6125].  For example, when
      SASL OAuth is run over IMAP then the IMAP profile of RFC 6125 is
      used.

   o  OAUTH10A-PLUS: The mutual_state flag (GSS_C_MUTUAL_FLAG) MUST be
      set to TRUE since server authentication.  The client demonstrates
      possession of the session key by applying a keyed message digest

      function over various fields of the request.  Server-side
      authentication is provided via TLS.

   Credential delegation is not supported with this specification.
   Therefore, security contexts MUST have the deleg_state flag
   (GSS_C_DELEG_FLAG) set to FALSE.

   OAuth mechanisms do not support per-message tokens or
   GSS_Pseudo_random.

   OAuth supports a standard generic name syntax for acceptors, such as
   GSS_C_NT_HOSTBASED_SERVICE (see Section 4.1 of [RFC2743]).  These
   service names MUST be associated with the "entityID" claimed by the
   RP.

   OAuth mechanisms support only a single name type for initiators:
   GSS_C_NT_USER_NAME.  GSS_C_NT_USER_NAME is the default name type.

   The query, display, and exported name syntaxes for OAuth principal
   names are all the same.  There is no OAuth-specific name syntax;
   applications SHOULD use generic GSS-API name types, such as
   GSS_C_NT_USER_NAME and GSS_C_NT_HOSTBASED_SERVICE (see Section 4 of
   [RFC2743]).  The exported name token does, of course, conform to
   Section 3.2 of [RFC2743], but the "NAME" part of the token should be
   treated as a potential input string to the OAuth name normalization
   rules.

5.  Examples

   These examples illustrate exchanges between an IMAP and SMTP clients
   and servers.

   Note to implementers: The SASL OAuth method names are case
   insensitive.  One example uses "Bearer" but that could as easily be
   "bearer", "BEARER", or "BeArEr".

5.1.  Successful Bearer Token Exchange

   This example shows a successful OAuth 2.0 bearer token exchange.
   Note that line breaks are inserted for readability and the underlying
   TLS establishment is not shown either.

   As required by IMAP [RFC3501], the payloads are base64-encoded.  The

   The same credential used in an SMTP exchange is shown below.  Note
   that line breaks are inserted for readability, and that the SMTP
   protocol terminates lines with CR and LF characters (ASCII values
   0x0D and 0x0A), these are not displayed explicitly in the example.

6.  Security Considerations

   OAuth 1.0a and OAuth 2 allows for a variety of deployment scenarios,
   and the security properties of these profiles vary.  As shown in
   Figure 1 this specification is aimed to be integrated into a larger
   OAuth deployment.  Application developers therefore need to
   understand the needs of their applications before selecting a
   specific SASL OAuth mechanism.  For OAuth 2.0 a detailed security
   document [RFC6819] provides guidance to select those OAuth 2.0
   components that help to mitigate threats for a given deployment.  For
   OAuth 1.0a Section 4 of RFC 5849 [RFC5849] provides guidance specific
   to OAuth 1.0.

   This document specifies three SASL and GSS-API Mechanisms for OAuth
   and each comes with different security properties.

   OAUTHBEARER:  This mechanism borrows from OAuth 2.0 bearer tokens
      [RFC6750].  RFC 6750 uses Transport Layer Security (TLS) to secure
      the protocol interaction, including the access token, between the
      client and the resource server.

   OAUTH10A:  This mechanism re-uses OAuth 1.0a MAC tokens (using the
      HMAC-SHA1 keyed message digest), as described in Section 3.4.2 of
      [RFC5849].  To compute the keyed message digest in the same way
      was in RFC 5839 this specification conveys additional parameters
      between the client and the server.

   OAUTH10A-PLUS:  This mechanism adds the channel binding [RFC5056]
      capability to OAUTH10A for protection against man-in-the-middle
      attacks.  OAUTH10A-PLUS mandates the usage of Transport Layer
      Security (TLS).

Internet-Draft      SASL/GSS-API Mechanisms for OAuth      February 2013


7.  Internationalization Considerations

   The identifer asserted by the OAuth authorization server about the
   resource owner inside the access token may be displayed to a human.
   For example, when SASL is used in the context of IMAP the resource
   server may assert the resource owner's email address to the IMAP
   server for usage in an email-based application.  The identifier may
   therefore contain internationalized characters and an application
   needs to ensure that the mapping between the identifier provided by
   OAuth is suitable for use with the application layer protocol SASL is
   incorporated into.

   At the time of writing the standardization of the assertion format
   (in JSON format) is still ongoing, see
   [I-D.ietf-oauth-json-web-token].

   o  Added canonicalization language.

   o

   -05

   o  Fixed the GS2 header language again.

   o  Separated out different OAuth schemes into different SASL
      mechanisms.  Took out the scheme in the error return.  Tuned up
      the IANA registrations.

   -04

   o  Changed user field to be carried in the gs2-header, and made gs2
      header explicit in all cases.

   o  Converted MAC examples to OAuth 1.0a.  Moved MAC to an informative
      reference.

   o  Changed to sending an empty client response (single control-A) as
      the second message of a failed sequence.

   o  Fixed channel binding prose to refer to the normative specs and
      removed the hashing of large channel binding data, which brought
      mroe problems than it solved.

   o  Added a SMTP examples for Bearer use case.

   -03

   o  Added user field into examples and fixed egregious errors there as
      well.

   o  Added text reminding developers that Authorization scheme names
      are case insensitive.

   -02

   o  Added the user data element back in.

   o  Minor editorial changes.

   -01

   o  Ripping out discovery.  Changed to refer to I-D.jones-appsawg-
      webfinger instead of WF and SWD older drafts.

   o  Replacing HTTP as the message format and adjusted all examples.

   -00

   o  Renamed draft into proper IETF naming format now that it's
      adopted.

   o  Minor fixes.
