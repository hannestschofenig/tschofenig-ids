        OAuth enables a third-party
   application to obtain limited access to a protected resource, either on
   behalf of a resource owner by orchestrating an approval interaction, or by allowing the
   third-party application to obtain access on its own behalf.
   </t>
      <t>This document defines how an application client uses credentials obtained via OAuth
        over the Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL)
        to access a protected resource at a resource serve.  Thereby, it enables
	schemes defined within the OAuth framework for non-HTTP-based application protocols.
      </t> 
      <t>Clients typically store the user's long-term credential. This does, however, lead to 
      significant security vulnerabilities, for example, when such a
      credential leaks. A significant benefit of OAuth for usage in
      those clients is that the password is replaced by a
      shared secret with higher entropy, i.e., the token. Tokens typically provide limited access rights and can
      be managed and revoked separately from the user's long-term password.

    <section title="Introduction">

	<t>OAuth 1.0a <xref target="RFC5849"/> and OAuth 2.0 <xref target="RFC6749"/> are protocol frameworks that enable a third-party
	application to obtain limited access to a protected resource, either on
   	behalf of a resource owner by orchestrating an approval interaction, or by allowing the
   	third-party application to obtain access on its own behalf. </t>
	
	<t>The core OAuth 2.0
        specification <xref target="RFC6749"/> specifies the interaction between the OAuth client and the authorization server; it does not define the interaction between the 
        OAuth client and the resource server for the access to a protected resource using an Access Token. 
        Instead, the OAuth client to resource server interaction is described in separate specifications, such as the bearer token specification <xref
          target="RFC6750"/> and the MAC Token specification <xref target="I-D.ietf-oauth-v2-http-mac"/>. OAuth 1.0a included the protocol specification for the communication between the OAuth client and the resource server 
		in <xref target="RFC5849"/>. 
    </t> 
          
      <t>The main use cases for OAuth 2.0 and OAuth 1.0a have so far focused on an HTTP-based <xref target="RFC2616"/> environment only. 
This document integrates OAuth 1.0a and OAuth 2.0 into non-HTTP-based applications using the integration into SASL.
Hence, this document  takes
        advantage of the OAuth protocol and its deployment base to provide a way to use 
        the Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) <xref target="RFC4422"/> to gain 
	access to resources when using non-HTTP-based protocols, such as the Internet Message 
	Access Protocol (IMAP) <xref target="RFC3501"/> and the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) 
	<xref target="RFC5321"/>, which is what this memo uses in the examples.</t>

<t>To illustrate the impact of integrating this specification into an OAuth-enabled application environment <xref target="overview"/> shows the abstract message flow of OAuth 2.0 <xref target="RFC6749"/>. As indicated in the figure, this document impacts the exchange of messages (E) and (F) since SASL is used for interaction between the client and the resource server instead of HTTP.</t>

<t>The Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) is a framework
   for providing authentication and data security services in
   connection-oriented protocols via replaceable authentication mechanisms.  It
   provides a structured interface between protocols and mechanisms.
   The resulting framework allows new protocols to reuse existing
   authentication protocols and allows old protocols to make use of new authentication mechanisms.
   The framework also provides a protocol for securing subsequent
   protocol exchanges within a data security layer.</t>
   
<t>When OAuth is integrated into SASL the high-level steps are as follows:
<list style="empty"> 
<t>  (A)  The client requests authorization from the resource owner.  The
        authorization request can be made directly to the resource owner
        (as shown), or preferably indirectly via the authorization
        server as an intermediary.</t>
<t>   (B)  The client receives an authorization grant which is a credential
        representing the resource owner's authorization, expressed using
        one of the grant types defined in <xref target="RFC6749"/> or <xref target="RFC5849"/> or using
        an extension grant type.  The authorization grant type depends
        on the method used by the client to request authorization and
        the types supported by the authorization server.</t>
<t>   (C)  The client requests an access token by authenticating with the
        authorization server and presenting the authorization grant.</t>
<t>   (D)  The authorization server authenticates the client and validates
        the authorization grant, and if valid issues an access token.</t>
<t>   (E)  The client requests the protected resource from the resource
        server and authenticates by presenting the access token.</t>
<t>   (F)  The resource server validates the access token, and if valid,
        indicates a successful authentication.</t>
</list> 
</t>

    <t>Again, steps (E) and (F) are not defined in <xref target="RFC6749"/> 
	   (but are described in, for example, <xref target="RFC6750"/> for the OAuth Bearer Token instead) and are the
       main functionality specified within this document. Consequently, 
	   the message exchange shown in <xref target="overview"/> is the result 
	   of this specification. The client will generally need to determine the 
	   authentication endpoints (and perhaps the service endpoints) before the 
	   OAuth 2.0 protocol exchange messages in steps (A)-(D) are executed. 
	   The discovery of the resource owner and authorization server endpoints is
       outside the scope of this specification.  The client must discover those
       endpoints using a discovery mechanisms, such as Webfinger using host-meta 
	   <xref target="RFC7033"/>.  In band discovery is not 
	   tenable if clients support the OAuth 2.0 password grant. Once credentials 
	   are obtained the client proceeds to steps (E) and (F) defined in this 
	   specification. 
      </t>
	  
	  <t>OAuth 1.0 follows a similar model but uses a different terminology and 
	  does not separate the resource server from the authorization server.</t>

    <section anchor="SASL-OAUTH" title="OAuth SASL Mechanism Specifications">

      <t>SASL is used as an authentication framework in a variety of application layer protocols. This
        document defines the following SASL mechanisms for usage with OAuth:

	<list><t>
	<list style="hanging">
	  <t hangText="OAUTHBEARER:">OAuth 2.0 bearer tokens, as described in <xref target="RFC6750"/>. RFC 6750 uses 
		Transport Layer Security (TLS) to secure the protocol interaction between the client and the resource server.</t>
	  <t hangText="OAUTH10A:">OAuth 1.0a MAC tokens (using the HMAC-SHA1 keyed message digest), as described in Section 
		3.4.2 of <xref target="RFC5849"/>.
	     </t>
	</list>
	</t></list>

    New extensions may be defined to add additional OAuth Access Token Types. Such a new SASL OAuth 
	mechanism can be added by simply registering the new name(s) and citing this
	specification for the further definition.  
     </t>

     <t>These mechanisms are client initiated and lock-step, the server always replying to a client 
	message.  In the case where the client has and correctly uses a valid token the flow is:

	<list style="numbers">
	  <t>Client sends a valid and correct initial client response.
	     </t>
	  <t>Server responds with a successful authentication.
	   	  </t>
	</list>

	In the case where authorization fails the server sends an error result, then client MUST
	then send an additional message to the server in order to allow the server to finish the
	exchange.  Some protocols and common SASL implementations do not support both sending a SASL
	message and finalizing a SASL negotiation, the additional client message in the error case
	deals with this problem.  This exchange is:

	<list style="numbers">
		<t>Client sends an invalid initial client response.</t>
		<t>Server responds with an error message. </t>
		<t>Client sends a dummy client response.</t>
		<t>Server fails the authentication.</t>
	</list>
	</t>

      <section title="Initial Client Response">
        <t>Client responses are a GS2 <xref target="RFC5801"/> header followed by a key/value pair sequence, or may be empty. The 
	gs2-header is defined here for compatibility with GS2 if a GS2 mechanism is formally defined, but this
        document does not define one.  These key/value pairs carry the equivalent values from 
        an HTTP context in order to be able to complete an OAuth style HTTP authorization.  
	Unknown key/value pairs MUST be ignored by the server. The ABNF <xref target="RFC5234"/> syntax is:

	For OAuth token types that use keyed message digests the client MUST send host and

      <section title="Server Response to Failed Authentication">

<t>
OAuth Access Token Types may use keyed message digests and the client and the resource server may need to perform a cryptographic computation for integrity protection and data origin authentication.</t>

<t>OAuth is designed for access to resources identified by URIs.  SASL is designed for user authentication, and
   has no facility for more fine-grained access control.  In this specification we require or

	  signature base string to be constructed properly.

          The default HTTP path is "/" and the default post body is empty.  These atoms are

    <section title="Security Considerations">
    
    <t>OAuth 1.0a and OAuth 2 allows for a variety of deployment scenarios, and the security
 properties of these profiles vary. As shown in <xref target="overview"/> this specification is aimed to be integrated into a larger OAuth deployment. Application developers therefore need to understand the needs of their security requirements based on a threat assessment before selecting a specific SASL OAuth mechanism. For OAuth 2.0 a detailed security document <xref target="RFC6819"/> provides guidance to select those OAuth 2.0 components that help to mitigate threats for a given deployment. For OAuth 1.0a Section 4 of RFC 5849 <xref target="RFC5849"/> provides guidance specific to OAuth 1.0.</t>

   <t>This document specifies two SASL  Mechanisms for OAuth and each comes with different security properties. 
   
   <list style="hanging">
	  <t hangText="OAUTHBEARER:">This mechanism borrows from OAuth 2.0 bearer tokens <xref target="RFC6750"/>. It relies on the application using TLS to protect the OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token exchange; without TLS usage at the application layer this method is completely insecure. Consequently, TLS MUST be provided by the application when choosing this authentication mechanism.</t>
	  
	  <t hangText="OAUTH10A:">This mechanism re-uses OAuth 1.0a MAC tokens (using the HMAC-SHA1 keyed message digest), as described in Section 3.4.2 of <xref target="RFC5849"/>. To compute the keyed message digest in the same way was in RFC 5839 this specification conveys additional parameters between the client and the server. This SASL mechanism only supports client authentication. If server-side authentication is desireable then it must be provided by the application underneath the SASL layer. The use of TLS is strongly RECOMMENDED. 
	     </t>
	</list>
	</t>
	
	<t>Additionally, the following aspects are worth pointing out:  
	
	<list style="hanging"> 
	  <t hangText="An access token is not equivalent to the user's long term password."><vspace blankLines="1"/> 
	  
	  Care has to be
   taken when these OAuth credentials are used for actions like changing
   passwords (as it is possible with some protocols, e.g., XMPP <xref target="RFC6120"/>). The
   resource server should ensure that actions taken in the authenticated channel
   are appropriate to the strength of the presented credential.</t>
	  
	  <t hangText="Lifetime of the appliation sessions."><vspace blankLines="1"/> 
	  It is possible that 
	  SASL will be authenticating a connection and the
   life of that connection may outlast the life of the access token used
   to establish it.  This is a common problem in application protocols
   where connections are long-lived, and not a problem with this
   mechanism per se. Resource servers may unilaterally disconnect clients in
   accordance with the application protocol.</t>


   <t hangText="Access tokens have a lifetime."><vspace blankLines="1"/> 
   Reducing the lifetime of an access
   token provides security benefits and OAuth 2.0 introduces refresh
   tokens to obtain new access token on the fly without any need for a human interaction. 
    Additionally, a previously obtained access token may be revoked or rendered invalid
   at any time. The client may request a new access token for each
   connection to a resource server, but it SHOULD cache and re-use
   valid credentials.</t>

	</list> 
	</t>
	
    </section>
    
    <!-- ******************************************************************** -->
    
     <section title="Internationalization Considerations">
	     <t>The identifer asserted by the OAuth authorization server about the resource owner inside the access token may be displayed to a human. For example, when SASL is used in the context of IMAP the resource server may assert the resource owner's email address to the IMAP server for usage in an email-based application. The identifier may therefore contain internationalized characters and an application needs to ensure that the mapping between the identifier provided by OAuth is suitable for use with the application layer protocol SASL is incorporated into.</t>
	     
	     <t>At the time of writing the standardization of the various claims in the access token (in JSON format) is still ongoing, see <xref target="I-D.ietf-oauth-json-web-token"/>. Once completed it will provide a standardized format for exchanging identity information between the authorization server and the resource server.</t>
