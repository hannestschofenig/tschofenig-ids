             Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) Callback
                 draft-ietf-ecrit-psap-callback-03.txt

Abstract

   After an emergency call is completed (either prematurely terminated
   by the emergency caller or normally by the call-taker) it is possible
   that the call-taker feels the need for further communication.  For
   example, the call may have been dropped by accident without the call-
   taker having sufficient information about the current situation of a
   wounded person.  A call-taker may trigger a callback towards the
   emergency caller using the contact information provided with the
   initial emergency call.  This callback could, under certain
   circumstances, be treated like any other call and as a consequence it
   may get blocked by authorization policies or may get forwarded to an
   answering machine.

   The IETF emergency services architecture offers capabilities to allow
   callbask to bypass authorization policies to reach the caller without
   unnecessary delays.  However, the mechanism specified prior to this
   document supports only limited scenarios.  This document discusses
   some shortcomings, presents additional scenarios where better-than-
   normal call treatment behavior would be desirable, and specifies a
   protocol solution.

1.  Introduction

   Summoning police, the fire department or an ambulance in emergencies
   is one of the fundamental and most-valued functions of the telephone.
   As telephone functionality moves from circuit-switched telephony to
   Internet telephony, its users rightfully expect that this core
   functionality will continue to work at least as well as it has for
   the legacy technology.  New devices and services are being made
   available that could be used to make a request for help, which are
   not traditional telephones, and users are increasingly expecting them
   to be used to place emergency calls.

   An overview of the protocol interactions for emergency calling using
   the IETF emergency services architecture are described in
   [I-D.ietf-ecrit-framework] and [I-D.ietf-ecrit-phonebcp] specifies
   the technical details.  As part of the emergency call setup procedure
   two important identifiers are conveyed to the PSAP call-taker's user
   agent, namely the Address-Of-Record (AoR), and the Globally Routable
   User Agent (UA) URIs (GRUU).  RFC 3261 [RFC3261] defines the AoR as:

      An address-of-record (AOR) is a SIP or SIPS URI that points to a
      domain with a location service that can map the URI to another URI
      where the user might be available.  Typically, the location
      service is populated through registrations.  An AOR is frequently
      thought of as the "public address" of the user.

   In SIP systems a single user can have a number of user agents
   (handsets, softphones, voicemail accounts, etc.) which are all
   referenced by the same AOR.  There are a number of cases in which it
   is desirable to have an identifier which addresses a single user
   agent rather than the group of user agents indicated by an AOR.  The
   GRUU is such a unique user- agent identifier, which is still globally
   routable.  [RFC5627] specifies how to obtain and use GRUUs.

   Regulatory requirements demand that the emergency call itself
   provides enough information to allow the call-taker to initiate a
   call back to the emergency caller in case the call dropped or to
   interact with the emergency caller in case of further questions.  The
   AoR and the GRUU serve this purpose.  The communication attempt by
   the PSAP call-taker back to the emergency caller is called 'PSAP
   callback'.

   A PSAP callback may, however, be blocked by user configured whitelis
   or may be forwarded to an answering machine as SIP entities (SIP
   proxies as well as the SIP UA itself) cannot differentiate the
   callback from any other SIP call establishing attempt from the SIP
   signaling message.

   While there are no regulatory requirements at the time of writing of
   this specification there is the believe that PSAP callbacks have to
   be treated in such a way that they reach the emergency caller.  For
   this purpose guidance for PSAP callback handling has been provided in
   Section 13 of [I-D.ietf-ecrit-framework]:

      A UA may be able to determine a PSAP call back by examining the
      domain of incoming calls after placing an emergency call and
      comparing that to the domain of the answering PSAP from the
      emergency call.  Any call from the same domain and directed to the
      supplied Contact header or AoR after an emergency call should be
      accepted as a call-back from the PSAP if it occurs within a
      reasonable time after an emergency call was placed.

   This approach mimics a stateful packet filtering firewall and is
   indeed helpful in a number of cases.  It is also relatively simple to
   implement.  Unfortunately, it does not work in all SIP deployment
   scenarios.  In Section 3 we describe scenarios where the currently
   standardized approach is insufficient.  In Section 4 a solution is
   described.

3.  Callback Scenarios

   This section illustrates a number of scenarios where the currently
   specified solution, as specified in [I-D.ietf-ecrit-phonebcp], for
   preferential treatment of callbacks fails.

3.1.  Routing Asymmetry

   In some deployment environments it is common to have incoming and
   outgoing SIP messaging to use different SIP infrastructure elements
   for routing.

3.2.  Multi-Stage Resolution

   Consider the following emergency call routing scenario shown in
   Figure 2 where routing towards the PSAP occurs in several stages.  An
   emergency call uses a SIP UA that does not run LoST on the end point.
   Hence, the call is marked with the 'urn:service:sos' Service URN
   [RFC5031].  The user's VoIP provider receives the emergency call and
   determines where to route it.  Local configuration or a LoST lookup
   might, in our example, reveal that emergency calls are routed via a
   dedicated provider FooBar and targeted to a specific entity, referred
   as esrp1@foobar.com.  FooBar does not handle emergency calls itself
   but performs another resolution step to let calls enter the emergency
   services network and in this case another resolution step takes place
   and esrp-a@esinet.org is determined as the recipient, pointing to an
   edge device at the IP-based emergency services network.  Inside the
   emergency services there might be more sophisticated routing taking
   place somewhat depending on the existing structure of the emergency
   services infrastructure.

3.3.  Call Forwarding

   Imagine the following case where an emergency call enters an
   emergency network (state.org) via an ERSP but then gets forwarded to
   a different emergency services network (in our example to police-
   town.org, fire-town.org or medic-town.org).  The same considerations
   apply when the the police, fire and ambulance networks are part of
   the state.org sub-domains (e.g., police.state.org).

3.4.  PSTN Interworking

   In case an emergency call enters the PSTN, as shown in Figure 4,
   there is no guarantee that the callback some time later does leave
   the same PSTN/VoIP gateway or that the same end point identifier is
   used in the forward as well as in the backward direction making it
   difficult to reliably detect PSAP callbacks.

3.5.  Network-based Service URN Resolution

   The mechanism described in [I-D.ietf-ecrit-framework] assumes that
   all devices at the call signaling path store information about the
   domain of the communication recipient.  This is necessary to match
   the stored domain name against the domain of the sender when an
   incoming call arrives.

Internet-Draft                PSAP Callback                 October 2011


   However, the IETF emergency services architecture also considers
   those cases where the resolution from the Service URN to the PSAP URI
   happens somewhere in the network rather than immediately at the end
   point itself.  In such a case, the end device is therefore not able
   to match the domain of the sender with any information from the
   outgoing emergency call.

   Figure 5 shows this message exchange graphically.

7.  Acknowledgements

   We would like to thank members from the ECRIT working group, in
   particular Brian Rosen, for their discussions around PSAP callbacks.
   The working group discussed the topic of callbacks at their virtual
   interim meeting in February 2010 and the following persons provided
   valuable input: John Elwell, Bernard Aboba, Cullen Jennings, Keith
   Drage, Marc Linsner, Roger Marshall, Dan Romascanu, Geoff Thompson,
   Janet Gunn.

   At IETF#81 a small group of people got to together to continue the
   discussions started at the working group meeting to explore a GRUU-
   based solution approach.  Martin Thomson, Marc Linsner, Andrew Allen,
   Brian Rosen, Martin Dolly, and Atle Monrad participated at this side-
   meeting.

   Finally, we would like to thank Cullen Jennings for his discussion
   input.  He was the first to propose a "token-based" solution.

1.  Alternative Solutions Considered

   In an attempt to describe the problem and to explore solution
   approaches the working group had also investigated alternative
   approaches.  We document them here for completeness.  The solutions
   fall into three categories: (1) Identity-based authorization, (2)
   Trait-based authorization, and (3) Call Marking.  Even though these
   solutions are not mutually exclusive we describe them in separate
   sub-sections.

   Beyond the disadvantages listed in each solution category none of
   them provides the emergency caller with the ability to restrict
   preferential PSAP callback handling to those cases where an earlier
   emergency call was initiated.

1.1.  Identity-based Authorization

   In Figure 6 an interaction is presented that allows a SIP entity to
   make a policy decision whether to bypass installed authorization
   policies and thereby providing preferential treatment.  To make this
   decision the sender's identity is compared with a whitelist of valid
   PSAPs.  The identity assurances in SIP can come in different forms,
   such as SIP Identity [RFC4474] or with P-Asserted-Identity [RFC3325].
   The former technique relies on a cryptographic assurance and the
   latter on a chain of trust.

                           (in whitelist)

                  Figure 6: Identity-based Authorization

   This approach was not chosen because the establishment of a whitelist
   containing PSAP identities is operationally complex and does not
   easily scale world wide.  Only when there is a local relationship
   between the VSP/ASP and the PSAP then populating the whitelist is far
   simpler.  This would, however, constrain the applicability of the
   mechanism considerably.

1.2.  Trait-based Authorization

   An alternative approach to an identity based authorization model is
   outlined in Figure 7.  In fact, RFC 4484 [RFC4484] illustrates a
   related emergency service use case.

                          PSAP)

                    Figure 7: Trait-based Authorization

   In a trait-based authorization scenario an incoming SIP message
   contains a form of trait, i.e. some form of assertion.  The assertion
   contains an indication that the sending party has the role of a PSAP
   (or similar emergency services entity).  The assertion is either
   cryptographically protected to enable end-to-end verification or an
   chain of trust security model has to be assumed.  In Figure 7 we
   assume an end-to-end security model where trust anchors are
   provisioned to ensure the ability for a SIP entity to verify the
   received assertion.

   This solution was not chosen because trait-based authorization never
   got deployed in SIP.  Furthermore, in order to ensure that the
   assertions are properly protected it is necessary to digitally sign,
   which requires some form of public key infrastructure for usage with
   emergency services.  Finally, there need to be some policies in place
   that define which entities are allowed to obtain various roles.
   These policies and procedures do not exist today.

1.3.  Call Marking

   Call marking allows the PSAP to place a non-cryptographic label on
   outgoing calls that gives, when received by a SIP entity,

   preferential treatment for these callbacks.

   When used in isolation this mechanism introduces considerable denial
   of service attacks due to the ability to bypass any authorization
   policies and could be utilized to distribute unwanted traffic.
