Abstract

   Surveillance is the observation or monitoring of an individual's
   communications or activities.  Surveillance is one of several privacy
   /security threats engineers try to take into account in their
   designs.  The reports about large-scale monitoring of Internet
   traffic have, however, surprised many since the scale was not
   envisaged during the design of many Internet protocols.  Also, the
   approach to get access to meta-data as well as communication content
   has taken forms that are largely indistinguishable from ordinary
   attacks.

   This document tries to explain the different facets of the attacks.
   The document does not try to suggest specific actions to improve the
   security and privacy of the Internet.

1.  Introduction

   Securing the Internet is a rather complicated task since the threat
   landscape has changed significantly over the last 20 years.  For many
   of the recognized security weaknesses solutions have been developed
   and standardized.  Unfortunately, the existence of specifications by
   itself is not enough: security protocols need to be implemented and
   deployed.  Since many of the tougher security challenges suffer from
   a collective action problem it typically takes years (for the core
   Internet infrastructure components) for a transition to more secure
   state (typically requiring sufficient energy and enough pain).  The
   recently observed pervasive monitoring activities represent a new
   challenge to the Internet community and require us to review and
   revisit some earlier made design decisions.

   To fully understand the role of the IETF in this context it is useful
   to look at the types of attacks that are occuring.  It quickly
   becomes clear that the responsiblities for developing countermeasures
   resides not only with the IETF but with the larger Internet eco-
   system.

2.  Attack Surface

   The attack surface is categorized into four areas, as shown in Figure
   1.  In subsequent sections more details are provided and examples are
   listed.

2.1.  Cryptographic Primitives

   Internet security relies on sound cryptographic primitives, such as
   hash functions, random number generators, integrity and encryption
   algorithms, etc.  The basic design philosophy is that the strength of
   keyed algorithm relies on the length of the key.  It is well-known
   that these cryptographic primitives "age" as processing power of
   computing hardware increases.  This means that over time it is faster
   to search through the entire key space with the same amount of
   financial budget spent.  Researchers have also made improvements in
   analysing the building blocks of these algorithms and new attack
   techniques (such as side channel attacks).  This has lead to a
   continued development of new cryptographic primitives.

   The IETF has played a minor role in the work on cryptographic
   primitives.  Instead, the IETF has rather been a consumer of these
   building blocks and has therefore relied on others to select
   specifications and to provide guidance.  As an exception one could

   see the publication of HMAC [21].  In fact, the crypto-community
   world-wide is rather small and for a variety of reasons the National
   Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has spearheaded many of
   these developments.  The IETF security community has relied on NIST
   to provide guidance largely because no other groups have come forward
   to provide any advice.

   While there have been problems with weaknesses in cryptographic
   primitives (e.g., RC4 [1], [2], [3]) those have been an issue from a
   standardization point of view thanks to 'crypto-aglity'.  Crypto-
   agility is the ability of a protocol to adapt to evolving
   cryptographic algorithms and security requirements.  This may include
   the provision of a modular mechanism to allow cryptographic
   algorithms to be updated without substantial disruption to deployed
   implementations.

   There have also been rumors about backdoors in elliptic curve
   cryptography as well [9].

2.2.  Protocols and Architecture

   Internet protocols and communication architectures belong to the core
   expertise of the IETF and a lot of work has been done in this regard.
   The IETF security community has been established after security
   considerations sections became a mandatory part of IETF
   specifications [22] and the overall understanding of security is
   fairly large thanks to education efforts, the security area
   directorate, and the push back from the IESG when questionalble
   documents arrive.  Still, there are a number of challenges.  For
   example, cryptographic attacks like BEAST [5], CRIME [6], and Lucky
   Thirteen [4] targeted the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol.
   More difficult to deal with are security and privacy challenges with
   entire architectures, as the design of email, instant messaging,
   voice over IP (VoIP), DNS, DHCP, and other protocols demonstrate.
   Section 8 of [20] provides an interesting summary of the design
   tradeoffs that had been made in the real-time communication
   architecture as used by VoIP and instant messaging.  The difficulty
   is often not in crafting a security at the level of a single
   specification but rather to ensure that the protocol development of
   an entire communication architecture provides good security and
   privacy properties after 10+ years of standardization when various
   different industry trends (such as cloud computing, and the
   JavaScript-based Web), and the interests of participating parties
   collide.  In many cases, the design decisions are subtle.  For
   example, the excitement of Web companies to use HTTP cookies [23] as
   a replacement for cryptographic authentication was hard to
   anticipate.  The large number of key exchange mechanisms standardized
   for VoIP might have confused the industry [17], [18], [16].

   Often, insecure versions of a protocol are standardized and completed
   first before the secure version is developed.  For example, consider
   security for HTTP, SIP, XMPP, eMail, etc.  While this may not have a
   consequence on paper it certainly impacts follow-up implementations
   and deployments.

   Improving security and privacy for different communication protocols
   has been subject of discussion on the IETF perpass list [10].  Note
   that some discussions go beyond suggesting actions for the IETF but
   rather belong the discussion in Section 2.3 and Section 2.4.  As
   another example of ongoing work is a document on best current
   practices for Transport Layer Security [19], which gathers experience
   from recent security attacks and recommends state-of-the-art
   ciphersuites.  The limitations of the public key infrastructure that
   had gotten a lot of attention around 2011: DigiNotar, a Dutch
   certificate authority, had a security breach and in the same year a
   Comodo affiliate was compromised.  Both cases lead to fraudulent
   issue of certificates.  The same structural vulnerability has been
   exploided by the NSA in man-in-the-middle attacks [15].

2.3.  Implementations

   Once standardization work is completed the specifications have to get
   implemented.  Often those who develop the specifications are not
   necessary the same parties that implement the software.  The
   specifications therefore have to offer enough context and be readable
   to avoid security problems via misinterpretation.  Also, those who
   implement and those who deploy are also not necessarily the same set
   of people.  For example, some developers write open source libraries
   useful for a wide range of communities, as it is the case with
   OpenSSL or GnuTLS.

   Implementations may show a number of security weaknesses, such as
   lack of security features, quality of the implementations (e.g.,
   implementations with insufficent penetration testing), weak pseudo-
   random number generators [7], [11], etc.  Since the source code of
   many implementations is not available to the public backdoors may be
   built-in [8].

   Many implementations of Web applications, however, suffer from basic
   vulnerabilities (such as injection or cross-site scripting attacks),
   as the top-10 charts of the Open Web Application Security Project
   (OWASP) reveal [13].  Sometimes vendors make design decision for
   their product implementations that lead to security vulnerabilities,
   for example when devices are shipped with default-passwords or with
   enabled debugging interfaces [14].

2.4.  Deployment

   Finally, the implementations of various protocols are put together
   and complete systems are deployed.  Those who deploy have to make
   various decisions that go beyond pure protocol aspects but also have
   to consider various configuration options.  These deployment
   decisions have an important impact on the provided privacy and
   security properties.  Examples include, backend server protocols
   secured only with "physical security" (i.e., without cryptographic
   security protection), email services without TLS protection, custom
   security designs (see, for example, WhatsApp [12]), etc.  With the
   juridiction the service is provided in certain responsiblities for
   data retention, and lawful intercept arise.
