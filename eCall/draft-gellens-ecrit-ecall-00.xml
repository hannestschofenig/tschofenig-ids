      <t>This 
document describes how to use IP-based emergency services mechanisms 
to support the next generation of the Pan European in-vehicle 
emergency call service defined under the eSafety initiative of the 
European Commission (generally referred to as "eCall"). eCall is a 
standardized and mandated system for a special form of emergency 
calls placed by vehicles.  eCall deployment is required by 2015 in 
European Union member states, and eCall is also being deployed in 
other regions.  eCall provides an integrated voice path and a 
standardized set of vehicle, sensor (e.g., crash related), and 
location data.  An eCall is recognized and handled as a specialized 
form of emergency call and is routed to a specialized eCall-capable 
Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) capable of processing the 
vehicle data and trained in handling emergency calls from vehicles. 
Currently, eCall functions over circuit-switched cellular telephony; 
work on next-generation eCall (NG-eCall, sometimes called 
packet-switched eCall or PS-eCall) is now in process, and this 
document assists in that work by describing how to support eCall 
within the IP-based emergency services infrastructure.</t>
     
 
<t>This document also registers a MIME Content Type and an Emergency 
Call Additional Data Block for the eCall vehicle data.</t>

<section anchor="scope" title="Document Scope">
        <t>This 
document is limited to the signaling, data exchange, and protocol 
needs of next-generation eCall (NG-eCall, also referred to as 
packet-switched eCall (PS-eCall) and all-IP eCall).  eCall itself is 
specified by 3GPP and CEN and these specifications include far 
greater scope than is covered here.</t>
    </section>


    <section 
anchor="intro" title="Introduction">

      <t>Emergency calls made 
from vehicles (e.g., in the event of a crash) assist in significantly 
reducing
        road deaths and injuries by allowing emergency 
services to be aware of the incident, the state of the vehicle, the 
location of the vehicle, and to have a voice channel with the vehicle 
occupants.  This enables a quick and appropriate response.</t>
 

        <t>The European Commission initiative of eCall was conceived 
in the late 1990s, and has evolved to a European Parliament decision 
requiring the implementation of compliant in-vehicle systems (IVS) in 
new vehicles and the deployment of eCall in the European Member 
States in 2015.  eCall is also being adopted in other regions.</t>
 

        <t>The pan-European eCall system provides a standardized and 
mandated mechanism for emergency calls by vehicles.  eCall 
establishes procedures for such calls to be placed by in-vehicle 
systems, recognized and processed by the network, and routed to a 
specialized PSAP where the vehicle data is available to assist the 
call taker in assessing and responding to the situation.  eCall 
provides a standard set of vehicle, sensor (e.g., crash related), and 
location data.</t>

      <t>An eCall may be either user-initiated or 
automatically triggered.  Automatically triggered eCalls indicate a 
car crash or some other serious incident (e.g., a fire)  and carry a 
greater presumption of risk of injury.  Manually triggered eCalls may 
be reports of serious hazards and are likely to require a different 
response than an automatically triggered eCall.  Manually triggered 
eCalls are also more likely to be false (e.g., accidental) calls and 
may thus be subject to different handling by the PSAP.</t>

 
<t>Currently, eCall is standardized (by 3GPP <xref target="SDO-3GPP" 
/> and CEN <xref target="CEN" />) as a 3GPP circuit-switched call 
over GSM (2G) or UMTS (3G).  An eCall flag in the call setup marks 
the call as an eCall, and further indicates if the call was 
automatically or manually triggered.  The call is routed to an 
eCall-capable PSAP, a voice channel is established between the 
vehicle and the PSAP, and an eCall in-band modem is used to carry a 
defined set of vehicle, sensor (e.g., crash related), and location 
data (the Minimum Set of Data or MSD) within the voice channel.  The 
same in-band mechanism is used for the PSAP to acknowledge successful 
receipt of the MSD, and optionally to request the vehicle to send a 
new MSD (e.g., to check if the state of or location of the vehicle or 
its occupants has changed).  Work on next-generation eCall (NG-eCall, 
also referred to as packet-switched eCall or PS eCall) is now in 
process.  NG-eCall moves from circuit switched to all-IP, and carries 
the vehicle data and other eCall-specific data as additional data 
associated with the call.  This document describes how IETF 
mechanisms are used to provide the signaling and data exchange of the 
next generation of pan-European eCall.</t>

    <section 
anchor="data" title="Vehicle Data">

<t>Pan-European eCall provides a 
standardized and mandated set of vehicle related data, known as the 
Minimum Set of Data (MSD). The European Committee for Standardization 
(CEN) has specified this data in EN 15722 <xref target="msd"/>, along 
with both ASN.1 and XML encodings for the MSD <xref target="msd"/>. 
Circuit-switched eCall uses the ASN.1 encoding (due to its more 
compact size).  The XML encoding is better suited for use in SIP 
messages and is used in this document.  (The ASN.1 encoding is 
specified in Annex A of EN 15722 <xref target="msd"/>, while the XML 
encoding is specified in Annex C.)</t>

<t>The "Additional Data 
related to an Emergency Call" document <xref 
target="additional-data-draft"/> establishes a general mechanism for 
attaching blocks of data to a SIP emergency call.  This document 
makes use of that mechanism to carry the eCall MSD in a SIP emergency 
call.</t>

<t>This document registers the 
'application/emergencyCall.eCall.MSD+xml') MIME Content-Type to 
enable the MSD to be carried in SIP.  This document also adds the 
'eCall.MSD' entry to the Emergency Call Additional Data Blocks 
registry (established by <xref target="additional-data-draft"/>) to 
enable the MSD to be recognized as such in a SIP-based eCall 
emergency call.</t>

    <section 
anchor="setup" title="Call Setup">

<t>In circuit-switched eCall, the 
IVS places a special form of a 112 emergency call which carries the 
eCall flag (indicating that the call is an eCall and also if the call 
was manually or automatically triggered); the mobile network operator 
(MNO) recognizes the eCall flag and routes the call to an 
eCall-capable PSAP; vehicle data is transmitted to the PSAP via the 
eCall in-band
modem (in the voice channel).</t>

<t>An 
In-Vehicle System (IVS) which supports NG-eCall transmits the MSD in 
accordance with <xref target="additional-data-draft"/> by encoding it 
as specified (per Appendix C of EN 15722 <xref target="msd"/>) and 
attaching it to an INVITE as a MIME body part. The body part is 
identified by its MIME content-type 
'application/emergencyCall.eCall.MSD+xml') in the Content-Type header 
field of the body part.  The body part is assigned a unique 
identifier which is listed in a Content-ID header field in the body 
part.  The INVITE is marked as containing the MSD by adding (or 
appending to) a Call-Info header field at the top level of the 
INVITE.  This Call-Info header field contains a CID URL referencing 
the body part's unique identifier, and a 'purpose' parameter 
identifying the data as the eCall MSD per the registry entry; the 
'purpose' parameter's value is 'emergencyCallData.' and the root of 
the MIME type (not including the
   'emergencyCall' prefix and any 
suffix such as '+xml' 
('purpose=emergencyCallData.eCall.MSD').</t>

<t>For NG-eCall, the 
IVS establishes an emergency call using the 3GPP IMS solution with a 
Request-URI indicating an eCall type of emergency call and with 
vehicle data attached; the MNO or ESInet recognizes the eCall URN and 
routes the call to a NG-eCall capable PSAP; the PSAP interpets the 
vehicle data sent with the call and makes it available to the call 
taker.</t>

   <t>This 
document registers new service URN children within the "sos" 
subservice.  These URNs provide the mechanism by which an eCall is 
identified, and differentiate between manually and automatically 
triggered eCalls (which may be subject to different treatment, 
depending on policy). The two service URNs are: 
urn:service:sos.ecall.automatic and 
urn:service:sos.ecall.manual</t>

    </section>

<section 
anchor="routing" title="Call Routing">

    <t>The routing rules for 
eCalls are likely to differ from those of other emergency calls 
because eCalls are special types of emergency calls (with 
implications for the types of response required) and need to be 
handled by specially designated PSAPs.  In an environment that uses 
ESInets, the originating network passes all types of emergency calls 
to an ESInet (which have a request URI containing the "SOS" service 
URN).  The ESInet is then responsible for routing such calls to the 
appropriate PSAP.  In an environment without an ESInet, the emergency 
services authorities and the originating network jointly determine 
how such calls are routed.</t>

    <section anchor="esinets" 
title="ESInets">
    <t>This section provides background information 
on ESInets for information only.</t>
    
    <t>An Emergency 
Services IP Network (ESInet) is a network operated by emergency 
services authorities.  It handles emergency call routing and 
processing before delivery to a PSAP.  In the NG1-1-2 architecture 
adopted by EENA, each PSAP is connected to one or more ESInets.  Each 
originating network is also connected to one or more ESInets.  The 
ESInets maintain policy-based routing rules which control the routing 
and processing of emergency calls.  The centralization of such rules 
within ESInets provides for a cleaner separation between the 
responsibilities of the originating network and that of the emergency 
services network, and provides greater flexibility and control over 
processing of emergency calls by the emergency services authorities. 
This makes it easier to react quickly to unusual situations that 
require changes in how emergency calls are routed or handled (e.g., a 
natural disaster closes a PSAP), as well as ease in making long-term 
changes that affect such routing (e.g., cooperative agreements to 
specially handle calls requiring translation or relay services). 
ESInets may support the ability to interwork NG-eCall to legacy eCall 
to handle eCall-capable PSAPs that are not IP PSAPs (similarly to the 
ability to interwork IP emergency calls to legacy non-IP PSAPs). 
Note that in order to support legacy eCall-capable PSAPs that are not 
IP PSAPs and are not attached to an ESInet, an originating network 
may need the ability to route an eCall itself (e.g., to an 
interworking facility with interconnection to a suitable legacy eCall 
capable PSAP) based on the eCall and manual or automatic 
indications.</t>
    </section>

</section>

<section 
anchor="test-calls" title="Test Calls">

   <t>eCall requires the 
ability to place test calls.  These are calls that are recognized and 
treated as eCalls but are not given emergency call treatment and are 
not handled by call takers.</t>
   
   <t>A service URN starting with 
"test." indicates a test call. For example,
 
"urn:service:test.sos.ecall.automatic" indicates such a test feature. 
This functionality is defined in <xref target="RFC6881"/>.</t>
   
 
<t>This document registers "urn:service:test.sos.ecall.automatic" and 
"urn:service:test.sos.ecall.manual" for eCall test 
calls.</t>

</section>


    <section anchor="metadata" 
title="eCall-Specific Data from PSAP to IVS">
    
    <t>eCall 
requires the ability for the PSAP to acknowledge successful receipt 
of the MSD, and for the PSAP to optionally request that the IVS send 
a new MSD (e.g., if the call taker wishes to see if the vehicle's 
state or location has changed).  Future enhancements are desired, for 
example, to enable the PSAPto send other requests to the vehicle, 
such as starting a video stream from on-board cameras (such as rear 
focus or blind-spot), locking or unlocking doors, sounding the horn, 
flashing the lights, etc.</t>

    <t>The same mechanism established 
in <xref target="additional-data-draft"/>, used in this document to 
carry the MSD from the IVS to the PSAP, can be used to carry a 
control data block from the PSAP to the IVS.  This eCall control 
block (also referred to as eCall metadata) is an XML structure 
containing eCall-specific elements.  When the PSAP needs to send an 
eCall control block that is in response to the MSD or other data sent 
by the IVS, the control block can be sent in the SIP response to the 
message containing the MSD or other data (e.g., the INVITE).  When 
the PSAP needs to send an eCall control block that is not an 
immediate response to an MSD or other data sent by the IVS, the 
control block can be transmitted from the PSAP to the IVS in a SIP 
INFO message within the established session. This creates a framework 
mechanism by which the PSAP can send eCall-specific data to the IVS. 
When the control data requests the IVS to send a new MSD or other 
data block, the IVS can do so in an INFO message within the session 
(it could also use re-INVITE but that is unnecessary when no aspect 
of the session or media is changing).</t>

    <section anchor="example" title="Example">
 
<t>
        <xref target="fig1"/> shows an eCall. The call uses the 
request URI 'urn:service:sos.ecall.automatic' service URN and is
 
recognized as an eCall, and further as one that was invoked 
automatically by the IVS due to a crash or other serious incident. 
In this example, the originating network routes the call to an ESInet 
(as for any emergency call in an environment with an ESInet).  The 
ESInet routes the call to the appropriate NG-eCall capable PSAP.  (In 
deployments where there is no ESInet, the originating network routes 
the call directly to the appropriate NG-eCall capable PSAP.)
 
The emergency call is received by the ESInet's Emergency Services 
Routing Proxy (ESRP), as the entry point to
        the ESInet. The 
ESRP routes the call to a PSAP, where it is received by a call 
taker.</t>

Considerations">
      <t>The security considerations described in 
<xref target="RFC5069"/> apply here.</t>
       
      <t>An eCall 
will carry two forms of location data: the network-provided location 
that is inherently part of IMS emergency calls (which may be 
determined in cooperation with or possibly entirely by the 
originating device), and the IVS-supplied location within the MSD. 
This is likely to be useful to the PSAP, especially when the two 
locations are independently determined.  The document <xref 
target="I-D.ietf-ecrit-trustworthy-location"/> discusses trust issues 
regarding location provided by or determined in cooperation with end 
devices.</t>
      
      <t>The mechanism by which the PSAP sends 
acknowledgment and optional requests to the vehicle requires 
authenticity considerations; when the PSAP request is received within 
an established session initiated by the vehicle as an eCall emergency 
call, there is a higher degree of trust that the source is indeed a 
PSAP.  If the PSAP request is received in other situations, such as a 
call-back, the trust issues in verifying that a call-back is indeed 
from a PSAP apply (see the PSAP Callback document <xref 
target="I-D.ietf-ecrit-psap-callback"/>).</t>

      <t>IANA is requested to

      <t>This service identifies a type of emergency call (placed by 
a specialized in-vehicle system and carrying standardized set of data 
related to the vehicle and crash or incident, and is needed to direct 
the call to a specialized public safety answering
        point 
(PSAP) with technical and operational capabilities to handle such 
calls. Two sub-services are registered as well, namely 
        
 
<list style='hanging'> 
        <t 
hangText="urn:service:sos.ecall.manual"><vspace blankLines="1"/> This 
service URN indicates that an eCall had been triggered based on the 
manual interaction of the driver or a passenger.</t>
        <t

        <t>IANA is 
also requested to register the URN 'urn:service:test.sos.ecall' under

<section title="MIME Content-type Registration for

	<t>This specification requests the registration of a new MIME

	<t>Optional parameters:  charset</t>
 
	<t>Indicates the character encoding of the XML content.</t>

 
						<t>Encoding considerations:

      Uses XML,

			<t>Security considerations:

 This content type is 
designed to carry vehicle and incident-related data during an 
emergency call.

      This data contains personal information 
including vehicle VIN,
      location, direction, etc.  Appropriate
 
precautions need to be taken to limit unauthorized access,
 
inappropriate disclosure to third parties, and eavesdropping of
 
this information.  In general, it is permissible for the data to be 
unprotected while briefly in transit within the Mobile Network 
Operator (MNO); the MNO is trusted to not permit the data to be 
accessed by third parties.  Sections 7 and Section 8 of
      <xref 
target="I-D.ietf-ecrit-additional-data"/> contain more 
discussion.</t>
