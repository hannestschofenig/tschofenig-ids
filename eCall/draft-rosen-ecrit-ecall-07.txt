           Internet Protocol-based In-Vehicle Emergency Call
                     draft-rosen-ecrit-ecall-07.txt

Abstract

   This document describes how to use a subset of the IETF-based
   emergency call framework for accomplishing emergency calling support
   in vehicles.  Simplifications are possible due to the nature of the
   functionality that is going to be provided in vehicles with the usage
   of GPS.  Additionally, further profiling needs to be done regarding
   the encoding of location information.

Internet-Draft     IP-based In-Vehicle Emergency Call      November 2012


1.  Introduction

   Emergency calls made from vehicles can assist with the objective of
   significantly reducing road deaths and injuries.  Unfortunately,
   drivers often have a poor location-awareness, especially on urban
   roads (also during night) and abroad.  In the most crucial cases, the
   victim(s) may not be able to call because they have been injured or
   trapped.

   In Europe the European Commission has launched the eCall initiative
   that may best be described as a user initiated or automatically
   triggered system to provide notifications to Public Safety Answering
   Point's (PSAP), by means of cellular communications, that a vehicle
   has crashed, and to provide geodetic location information and where
   possible a voice channel to the PSAP.  At the time of writing the
   suppor for eCall are focused on legacy technology.  This document
   details how emergency calls triggered by vehicles can be accomplished
   in an Internet Protocol-based environment.

   This document is organized as follows:  Section 2 defines the
   terminology, Section 3 illustrates the required protocol
   functionality, Section 4 indicates the required data that has to be
   transmitted within a PIDF-LO and Section 5 shows an example message
   exchange.  This document concludes with the security considerations
   in Section 6 and IANA considerations in Section 7.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [1].

   This document re-uses a lot of the terminology defined in Section 3
   of [9].

3.  Protocol Profile

   The usage of in-vehicular emergency calls does not require the usage
   of a Location Configuration Protocol since GPS is used.  Furthermore,
   since the GPS receiver is permanently turned on it can even provide
   useful information in cases where the car entered a tunnel.
   Consequently, there is no need to discover any Location Information
   Server (LIS).

   Since the emergency call within the car is either triggered by a
   button or, in most cases, automatically thanks to sensors mounted in
   the car there is no need to learn a dial string.  This document
   registers a separate service URN, namely 'urn:service:sos.ecall',
   used specifically for emergency calls that are initiated from
   vehicles.  This URN comes with two sub-services to indicate how the
   emergency call was triggered, namely 'automatic' for cases when the
   emergency call was triggered due to a crash automatically without any
   user involvement and 'manual' for cases where a driver or a passenger
   triggered the emergency call.  If the device initiating the emergency
   call does not allow to differentiate these two cases then the Service
   URN 'urn:service:sos.ecall' is used.

   The following list provides information about the sections and
   requires of [2] that are relevant to this specification:

   Identifying an emergency call:  Emergency calls are detected at the
      end device, i.e., by the vehicle, and the service URN
      'urn:service:sos.ecall', 'urn:service:sos.ecall.automatic', or
      'urn:service:sos.ecall.manual' MUST be implemented by the end
      device.  The requirements listed in Section 5 of [2] related to
      identifying an emergency call based on dial strings are not
      applicable to this specification.

   Location:  The encoding of the PIDF-LO [3] is described in Section 4.
      In an emergency, the end point adds the available location
      information to the initial SIP INVITE emergency call message.  In
      special cases a location update may be provided, using the
      procedure described in requirement ED-38 of Section 6.8 of [2];
      all other aspects of Section 6.8 from that document are not
      applicable to this specification.  Section 6.2.1, 6.2.2, 6.2.4,
      6.4, 6.5 and 6.6 of [2] are not applicable to this document.  For
      location conveyance in SIP [4] MUST be used.  Further aspects that
      are not relevant for this document are multiple locations (Section
      6.9 of [2]), location validation (Section 6.10 of [2]), default
      location (Section 6.11 of [2])

Internet-Draft     IP-based In-Vehicle Emergency Call      November 2012


   LoST:  Emergency call routing support, for example utilizing LoST, is
      provided by VSP.  As such, the description in Section 8 of [2] is
      applicable to this document, except for requirement SP-25 and
      SP-26 regarding legacy devices.

   Signaling of emergency calls:  Section 9 of [2] is applicable to this
      document with the following exception:  ED-60/AN-25 is not
      applicable as HELD is not used.  Video and real-time text may be
      supported by end device in the future, although currently not
      envisioned.  The corresponding text paragraphs are relevant from
      Section 9 of [2] when support is being provided.  Additionally,
      ED-62 dealing with "SIP signaling requirements for User Agents" is
      simplified as follows.  The initial SIP signaling method is an
      INVITE request with the following setting:

      1.   The Request URI MUST be the service URN
           'urn:service:sos.ecall' or one of the sub-services.

      2.   The To header MUST be a service URN 'urn:service:sos.ecall'
           or one of the sub-services.

      3.   The From header MUST be present and SHOULD be the AoR of the
           caller.

      4.   A Via header MUST be present.

      5.   A Contact header MUST be present which MUST be globally
           routable to permit an immediate call-back to the specific
           device which placed the emergency call.

      6.   Other headers MAY be included as per normal SIP behavior.

      7.   A Supported header MUST be included with the 'geolocation'
           option tag [4].

      8.   The device MUST include location by-value into the call.

      9.   A normal SDP offer SHOULD be included in the INVITE.  If
           voice is supported the offer SHOULD include the G.711 codec,
           if a voice channel can be established based on the equipment
           in the car.

      10.  If the device includes location-by-value, the UA MUST support
           multipart message bodies, since SDP will likely be also in
           the INVITE.

      11.  SIP Caller Preferences [5] MAY be used to signal how the PSAP
           should handle the call.  For example, a language preference

Internet-Draft     IP-based In-Vehicle Emergency Call      November 2012


           expressed in an Accept-Language header may be used as a hint
           to cause the PSAP to route the call to a call taker who
           speaks the requested language.  SIP Caller Preferences may
           also be used to indicate a need to invoke a relay service for
           communication with people with disabilities in the call.

   Call backs:  The description in Section 10 of [2] is relevant for
      this document.

   Mid-call behavior:  The description in Section 11 of [2] is fully
      applicable to this document.

   Call termination:  The description in Section 12 of [2] is fully
      applicable to this document.

   Disabling of features:  The description in Section 13 of [2] is fully
      applicable to this document.

   Media:  If hardware and software for real-time text, voice, and video
      is available in the end device then the requirements regarding
      multi-media support described in [2] are applicable.

   Testing:  The description in Section 15 of [2] is fully applicable to
      this document.

4.  Data Profile

   Due to the requirement for a built-in GPS receiver only geodetic
   location information will be sent within an emergency call.
   Furthermore, the number of location shapes is is restricted.  Hence,
   the following location shapes of [6] MUST be implemented:  2d and 3d
   Point (see Section 5.2.1 of [6]), Circle (see Section 5.2.3 of [6]),
   and Ellipsoid (see Section 5.2.7 of [6]).  The coordinate reference
   systems (CRS) specified in [6] are also mandatory for this document.
   Furthermore, the direction of travel of the vehicle is important for
   dispatch and hence it MUST be included in the PIDF-LO.  The <heading>
   element specified in [7] MUST be supported.

5.  Example

   Figure 1 shows an emergency call placed from a vehicle whereby
   location information information is directly attached to the SIP
   INVITE message itself.  The call is marked as an emergency call using
   the 'urn:service:sos.ecall.automatic' service URN and the PSAP of the
   VoIP provider determines which PSAP to contact based on the provided
   location information.  As shown in the figure, this route
   determination may be based on LoST.  Then, the emergency call
   continues towards the PSAP and in this example it hits the ESRP, as
   the entry point to the PSAP operators emergency services network.
   Finally, the emergency call will be received by a call taker and
   first reponders will be dispatched.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document does not raise security considerations beyond those
   described in [10].  As with emergency service systems with end host
   provided location information there is the possibility that that
   location is incorrect, either intentially (in case of an a denial of
   service attack against the emergency services infrastructure) or due
   to a malfunctioning devices.  The reader is referred to [11] for a
   discussion of some of these vulnerabilities.

Internet-Draft     IP-based In-Vehicle Emergency Call      November 2012


7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to register the URN 'urn:service:sos.ecall' under
   the sub-services 'sos' registry defined in Section 4.2 of [8].

   This service identifier reaches a public safety answering point
   (PSAP), which in turn dispatches aid appropriate to the emergency
   related to accidents of vehicles.  Two sub-services are registered as
   well, namely

   urn:service:sos.ecall.manual  This service URN indicates that an
      eCall had been triggered based on the manual interaction of the
      driver or a passenger.

   urn:service:sos.ecall.automatic  This service URN indicates that an
      eCall had been triggered automatically, for example, due to a
      crash.  No human involvement was detected.
