     <abstract>
       <t>This document describes how to use 
IP-based emergency services mechanisms to support 
the next generation of emergency calls  placed by 
vehicles (automatically in the event of a crash 
or serious incident, or manually invoked by a 
vehicle occupant) and conveying vehicle, sensor, 
and location data related to the crash or incident. 
Such calls are often referred to as "Automatic 
Crash Notification" (ACN), or "Advanced Automatic 
Crash Notification" (AACN), even in the case of 
manual trigger.  The "Advanced" qualifier refers 
to the ability to carry a richer set of data.</t>

      <t>This document also registers a MIME 
Content Type and an Emergency Call Additional 
Data Block for the vehicle, sensor, and location 
data (often referred to as "crash data" even 
though there is not necessarily a crash).</t>

     <t>Profiling and simplifications are possible due to the
         nature of the functionality that is 
provided in vehicles with the usage of Global 
Satellite Navigation System (GNSS).</t>

     <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
       <t>Emergency calls made by in-vehicle 
systems (e.g., in the event of a crash) assist in 
significantly reducing
         road deaths and injuries by allowing 
emergency services to respond quickly and often 
with better location.</t>

     <t>Drivers often have a poor location awareness,
         especially outside of major cities, at 
night and when away from home (especially 
abroad).  In the most crucial cases, the
         victim(s) may not be able to call because 
they have been injured or trapped.</t>

     <t>For more than a decade, some vehicles have 
been equipped with telematics systems that, among 
other features, place an emergency call 
automatically in the event of a crash or manually 
in response to an emergency call button.  Such 
systems generally have on-board location 
determination systems that make use of 
satellite-based positioning technology, inertial 
sensors, gyroscopes, etc., to provide a fairly 
accurate position for the vehicle.  Such built-in 
systems can take advantage of the benefits of 
being integrated into a vehicle, such as more 
reliable power, ability to have larger or 
specialized antenna, ability to be engineered to 
avoid or minimise degradation by vehicle glass 
coatings, interference from other vehicle 
systems, etc.  Thus, the PSAP can be provided 
with a good estimate of where the vehicle is 
during an emergency.  Vehicle manufacturers are 
increasingly adopting such systems, both for the 
safety benefits and for the additional features 
and services they enable (e.g., remote engine 
diagnostics, remote door unlock, stolen vehicle 
tracking and disabling, etc.).</t>

     <t>The general term for such systems is 
Automatic Crash Notification (ACN) or "Advanced 
Automatic Crash Notification" (AACN).  "ACN" is 
used in this document as a general term.  ACN 
systems transmit some amount of data specific to 
the incident, referred to generally as "crash 
data."  While different systems transmit 
different amounts of crash data, standardized 
formats, structures, and mechanisms are needed to 
provide interoperability among systems and 
PSAPs.</t>

     <t>Currently deployed in-vehicle telematics 
systems are circuit-switched and lack a 
standards-based ability to convey crash data 
directly to the PSAP (generally relying on either 
a human call taker or an automated system to 
provide the PSAP call taker with some crash data 
orally, or possibly a proprietary mechanism) and 
are difficult to extend as new sensors are 
added.</t>

     <t>The transition to next-generation calling 
in general, and emergency calling in particular, 
provides an opportunity to vastly improve the 
scope, breadth, reliability and usefulness of 
crash data during an emergency by allowing it to 
be presented alongside the call, and to be 
automatically processed by the PSAP and made 
available to the call taker in an integrated, 
automated way.  In addition, vehicle 
manufacturers are provided an opportunity to take 
advantage of the same standardized mechanisms for 
data transmission for internal use if they wish 
(such as telemetry between the vehicle and a 
service center for both emergency and 
non-emergency uses, including location-based 
services, multi-media entertainment systems, and 
road-side assistance applications).</t>

     <t>Next-generation ACN provides an 
opportunity for such calls to be recognized and 
processed as such during call set-up, and routed 
to a specialized PSAP where the vehicle data is 
available to assist the call taker in assessing 
and responding to the situation.</t>

     <t>An ACN call may be either 
occupant-initiated or automatically triggered. 
(The "A" in "ACN" does stand for "Automatic," but 
the term is often used to refer to the class of 
calls that are placed by an in-vehicle system 
(IVS) and that carry incident-related data as 
well as voice.)  Automatically triggered calls 
indicate a car crash or some other serious 
incident (e.g., a fire)  and carry a greater 
presumption of risk of injury.  Manually 
triggered calls are often reports of serious 
hazards (such as drunk drivers) and may require 
different responses depending on the situation. 
Manually triggered calls are also more likely to 
be false (e.g., accidental) calls and may thus be 
subject to different handling by the PSAP.</t>

<t>This document describes how existing IETF 
mechanisms can be used to provide the realization 
of next-generation ACN.</t>

<t>The Association of Public-Safety 
Communications Officials (APCO) and the National 
Emergency Number Association (NENA) have jointly 
developed a standardized set of incident-related 
vehicle data for ACN use, called the Vehicle 
Emergency Data Set (VEDS) <xref target="VEDS"/>. 
Such data is often referred to as crash data 
although it is applicable in incidents other than 
crashes.</t>

     <t>VEDS provides a standard data set for the 
transmission, exchange, and interpretation of 
vehicle-related data.  A standard data format 
allows the data to be generated by an IVS, and 
interpreted by PSAPs, emergency responders, and 
medical facilities (including those capable of 
providing trauma level patient care).  It 
includes incident-related information such as 
airbag deployment, location of the vehicle, if 
the vehicle was involved in a rollover, and even 
various sensor data that can indicate the 
potential severity of the crash and the 
likelihood of severe injuries to the vehicle's 
occupants.  This data better informs the PSAP and 
emergency responders as to the type of response 
that may be needed. This information was recently 
included in the federal guidelines for field 
triage of injured patients. These guidelines are 
designed to help responders at the accident scene 
identify the potential existence of severe 
internal injuries and to make critical decisions 
about how and where a patient needs to be 
transported.</t>

<t>This document registers the 
'application/emergencyCall.VEDS+xml' MIME 
content-type, and registers the 'VEDS' entry in 
the Emergency Call Additional Data registry.</t>

<t>VEDS is an XML structure (see <xref target="VEDS"/>). The 'application/emergencyCall.VEDS+xml' 
MIME content-type is used to identify it. The 
'VEDS' entry in the Emergency Call Additional 
Data registry is used to construct a 'purpose' 
parameter value for conveying VEDS data in a 
Call-Info header (as described in <xref 
target="additional-data-draft"/>).</t>

<t>VEDS is a versatile structure that can 
accomodate varied needs.  However, if additional 
sets of data are determined to be needed, the 
steps to enable each data block are very briefly 
summarized below:

     <?rfc subcompact="yes"?>
     <list style="symbols">
         <t>A standardized format and encoding 
(such as XML) is defined and published by a 
Standards Development Organization (SDO).</t>
         <t>A MIME Content-Type is registered for 
it (typically under the 'Application' media type 
and with a sub-type starting with 
'emergencyCall.').</t>
         <t>An entry for the block is added to the 
Emergency Call Additional Data Blocks 
sub-registry (established by <xref 
target="additional-data-draft"/>); the registry 
entry is the root of the MIME sub-type (not 
including the 'emergencyCall' prefix and any 
suffix such as '+xml').</t>
     </list>
     <?rfc subcompact="no"?>
</t>

<t>A next-generation In-Vehicle System (IVS) 
transmits crash data by encoding it in a 
standardized and registered format (such as VEDS) 
and attaching it to an INVITE as a MIME body 
part. The body part is identified by its MIME 
content-type (such as 
'application/emergencyCall.VEDS+xml') in the 
Content-Type header field of the body part.  The 
body part is assigned a unique identifier which 
is listed in a Content-ID header field in the 
body part.  The INVITE is marked as containing 
the crash data by adding (or appending to) a 
Call-Info header field at the top level of the 
INVITE.  The Call-Info header field contains a 
CID URL referencing the body part's unique 
identifier, and a 'purpose' parameter identifying 
the data as the crash data per the registry 
entry; the 'purpose' parameter's value is 
'emergencyCallData.' and the root of the MIME 
type (not including the
'emergencyCall' prefix and any suffix such as 
'+xml' (such as 
'purpose=emergencyCallData.VEDS').</t>

<t>The mechanisms described here can be used 
place emergency calls that are identifiable as 
ACN calls and that carry one or more standardized 
crash data objects in an interoperable way.</t>

<t>Note that while ACN systems in the U.S. and 
other regions are not currently mandated, Europe 
has a mandated and standardized system for 
emergency calls by in-vehicle systems.  This 
pan-European system is known as "eCall" and is 
not further discussed in this document but is the 
subject of a separate document, <xref 
target="eCall-draft"/>

<section title="Overview of Current Deployment Models">

<t>Current (circuit-switched or legacy) systems 
for placing emergency calls by in-vehicle 
systems, including automatic crash notification 
systems, generally have a limited ability to 
convey at least location and in some cases 
telematics data to the PSAP.  Most such systems 
use one of three architectural models, which are 
described here as: "Telematics Service Provider" 
(TSP), "direct", and "paired handset". These 
three models are illustrated below.</t>

<t>In the TSP model, both emergency and 
non-emergency calls are placed to a Telematics 
Service Provider (TSP); a proprietary technique 
is used for data transfer (such as proprietary 
in-band modems) to the TSP.</t>

<t>In an emergency, the TSP call taker bridges in 
the PSAP and communicates location, crash data 
(such as impact severity and trauma prediction), 
and other data (such as the vehicle description) 
to the PSAP call taker verbally.  Typically, a 
three-way voice call is established between the 
vehicle, the TSP, and the PSAP, allowing 
communication between the PSAP call taker, the 
TSP call taker, and the vehicle occupants (who 
might be unconscious).</t>
<t>

         </figure>
       </t>



<t>In the paired model, the IVS uses a Bluetooth 
link with a previously-paired handset to
establish an emergency call with the PSAP (by 
dialing a standard emergency number such as 
9-1-1), and then communicates
location data to the PSAP via text-to-speech; crash data is not
conveyed.  Some such systems use an automated 
voice prompt menu (e.g., "this is an automatic 
emergency call from a vehicle; press 1 to open a 
voice path to the vehicle; press 2 to hear the 
location read out") to allow the call taker to 
request location data via text-to-speech.</t>

       </t>



<t>In the direct model, the IVS directly places 
an emergency call with the PSAP by dialing a 
standard emergency number such as 9-1-1.  Such 
systems might communicate
location data to the PSAP via text-to-speech; 
crash data might not be conveyed.</t>

<section title="Document Scope">

<t>This document is focused on the interface to 
the PSAP, that is, how an ACN emergency call is 
setup and incident-related data (including 
vehicle, sensor, and location data) is 
transmitted to the PSAP using IETF 
specifications. (The goal is to re-use 
specifications rather than to invent new.)  For 
the direct model, this is the
end-to-end description (between the vehicle and 
the PSAP).  For the TSP model, this describes the
right-hand side (between the TSP and the PSAP), 
leaving the left-hand side (between the vehicle 
and the TSP) up to the entities involved
(i.e., IVS and TSP vendors) who are then free to use the same mechanism
as for the right-hand side (or not).
</t>

<t>This document does not address pan-European 
eCall (a mandated and standardized system for 
emergency calls by in-vehicle systems within 
Europe and other regions), which is the subject 
of a separate document, <xref 
target="eCall-draft"/>
</t>

</section>

<section title="Migration to Next-Generation">

<t>Migration of emergency calls placed by 
in-vehicle systems to next-generation (all-IP) 
technology provides a standardized mechanism to 
identify such calls and to present crash data 
with the call.  This allows ACN calls and crash 
data to be automatically processed by the PSAP 
and made available to the call taker in an 
integrated, automated way.</t>

<t>Vehicle manufacturers using the TSP model may 
choose to take advantage of the same mechanism to 
carry telematics data between the vehicle and the 
TSP for both emergency and non-emergency 
calls.</t>

<t>A next-generation IVS establishes an emergency 
call using the 3GPP IMS solution with a 
Request-URI indicating an ACN type of emergency 
call with vehicle data attached; the MNO only 
needs to recognize the call as an emergency call 
and route it to an ESInet; the ESInet recognizes 
the call as an ACN with vehicle data and routes 
the call to an NG-ACN capable PSAP; the PSAP 
interpets the vehicle data sent with the call and 
makes it available to the call taker.</t>

<t>Because of the need to identify and specially 
process Next-Generation ACN calls (as discussed 
above), this document registers new service URN 
children within the "sos" subservice.  These URNs 
provide the mechanism by which an NG-ACN call is 
identified, and differentiate between manually 
and automatically triggered NG-ACN calls (which 
may be subject to different treatment, depending 
on policy). The two service URNs are: 
'urn:service:sos.vehicle.automatic' and 
'urn:service:sos.vehicle.manual'.</t>

<t>Migration of the three architectural models to 
next-generation (all-IP) is described below.</t>

<t>In the TSP model, the IVS transmits crash and 
location data to the TSP using either a protocol 
that is based on a proprietary design or one that 
re-uses IETF specifications.  In an emergency, 
the TSP call taker bridges in the PSAP and the 
TSP transmits
crash and other data to the PSAP using IETF specifications.  There
is a three-way call between the vehicle, the TSP, 
and the PSAP, allowing communication between the 
PSAP call taker, the TSP call taker, and the 
vehicle occupants (who might be unconscious).</t>
<t>

<t>The vehicle manufacturer and the TSP may 
choose to use the same IETF specifications to 
transmit crash and location data from the vehicle 
to the TSP as is described here to transmit such 
data from the TSP to the PSAP.</t>



<t>In the paired model, the IVS uses a Bluetooth link to a
previously-paired handset to establish an emergency call with the
PSAP; it is not clear what facilities are or will be available for
transmitting crash data through the Bluetooth link.</t>

         5.2.7 of <xref target="RFC5491"/>). The coordinate reference
         systems (CRS) specified in <xref target="RFC5491"/> are also
         mandatory for this document. The 
&lt;direction&gt; element, as defined in <xref 
target="RFC5962"/> which indicates the direction 
of travel of the vehicle, is
         important for dispatch and hence it MUST 
be included in the PIDF-LO . The
         &lt;heading&gt; element specified in <xref
           target="RFC5962"/> MUST be implemented and MAY be included. </t>

<t>Calls by in-vehicle systems are placed via 
cellular networks, which may ignore location sent 
by an originating device in an emergency call 
INVITE, instead attaching their own location 
(often determined in cooperation with the 
originating device).  The IVS MAY attach location 
data to the call INVITE.  Standardized crash data 
structures often include location as determined 
by the IVS.  A benefit of this is that it allows 
the PSAP to see both the location as determined 
by the cellular network (often in cooperation 
with the originating device) and the location as 
determined by the IVS.</t>

	<t>This specification also inherits the 
ability to utilize test call functionality from 
Section 15 of <xref target="RFC6881"/>.</t>
     </section>

<section title="Call Setup">
<t>It is important that ACN calls be easily 
identifiable as such at all stages of call 
handling, and that automatic versis manual 
triggering be known.  ACN calls differ from 
general emergency calls in several aspects, 
including the presence of standardized crash 
data, the fact that the call is known to be 
placed by an in-vehicle system (which has 
implications for PSAP operational processes), 
and, especially for automatic calls, information 
that may indicate a likelihood of severe injury 
and hence need for trauma services.  Knowledge 
that a call is an ACN and further that it was 
automatically or manually invoked carries a range 
of implications about the call, the 
circumstances, and the vehicle occupants.  Calls 
by in-vehicle systems may be considered a 
specific sub-class of general emergency calls and 
need to be handled by a PSAP with the technical 
and operational capabilities to serve such calls. 
(This is especially so in environments such as 
the U.S. where there are many PSAPs and where 
individual PSAPs have a range of capabilities.) 
Technical capabilities include the ability to 
recognize and process standardized crash data. 
Operational capabilities include training and 
processes for assessing severe injury likelihood 
and responding appropriately (e.g., dispatching 
trauma-capable medical responders, transporting 
victims to a trauma center, alerting the 
receiving facility, etc.).
</t>

<t>Because ACN calls differ in significant ways 
from general emergency calls, and because such 
calls need to be handled by specialized PSAPs 
(equipped technically to interpet and make use of 
crash data, and operationally to handle emergency 
calls placed by in-vehicle systems), this 
document proposes an SOS sub-service for ACN/car 
crash, specifically, "SOS.vehicle".  Using a 
sub-service makes it readily obvious that the 
call is an ACN; a further child elements is 
proposed to distinguish calls automatically 
placed due to a crash or other serious incident 
(such as a fire) from those manually invoked by a 
vehicle occupant (specifically, 
"SOS.vehicle.automatic" and 
"SOS.vehicle.manual").  The distinction between 
automatic and manual invocation is also 
significant; automatically triggered calls 
indicate a car crash or some other serious 
incident (e.g., a fire) and carry a greater 
presumption of risk of injury and hence need for 
specific responders (such as trauma or fire). 
Manually triggered calls are often reports of 
serious hazards (such as drunk drivers) and may 
require different responses depending on the 
situation.  Manually triggered calls are also 
more likely to be false (e.g., accidental) calls 
and may thus be subject to different handling by 
the PSAP.</t>

<t>A next-generation In-Vehicle System (IVS) 
transmits crash data by encoding it in a 
standardized and registered format and attaching 
it to an INVITE as an additional data block as 
specified in Section 4.1 of <xref 
target="additional-data-draft"/>.  As described 
in that document, the block is identified by its 
MIME content-type, and pointed to by a CID URL in 
a Call-Info header with a 'purpose' parameter 
value corresponding to the block.</t>

<t>
Specifically, the steps required during standardization are:
     <list style="symbols">
         <t>A set of crash data is standardized by 
an SDO or appropriate organization</t>
         <t>A MIME Content-Type for the crash data set is registered with IANA
             <list style="symbols">
             <t>If the data is specifically for 
use in emergency calling, the MIME type is 
normally under the 'application' type with a 
subtype starting with 'emergencyCall.'</t>
             <t>If the data format is XML there is 
by convention a suffix of '+xml'</t>
             </list>
         </t>
         <t>The item is registered in the 
Emergency Call Additional Data registry, as 
defined in Section 9.1.7 of <xref 
target="additional-data-draft"/>
             <list style="symbols">
             <t>For emergency-call-specific 
formats, the registered name is the root of the 
MIME Content-Type (not including the 
'emergencyCall' prefix and any suffix such as 
'+xml') as described in Section 4.1 of <xref 
target="additional-data-draft"/></t>
             </list>
         </t>
     </list>
</t>

<t>
When placing an emergency call:
     <list style="symbols">
         <t>The crash data set is created and encoded per its specification</t>
         <t>The crash data set is attached to the 
emergency call INVITE as specified in Section 4.1 
of <xref target="additional-data-draft"/>, that 
is, as a MIME body part identified by its MIME 
Content-Type in the body part's Content-Type 
header field</t>
         <t>The body part is assigned a unique 
identifier label in a Content-ID header field of 
the body part</t>
         <t>A Call-Info header field at the top 
level of the INVITE references the crash data and 
identifies it by its MIME root (as registered in 
the Emergency Call Additional Data registry)
             <list style="symbols">
             <t>The crash data is referenced in 
the Call-Info header field by a CID URL that 
contains the unique Content ID assigned to the 
crash data body part</t>
             <t>The crash data is identified in 
the Call-Info header field by a 'purpose' 
parameter whose value is 'emergencyCallData.' 
concatenated with the specific crash data entry 
in the Emergency Call Additional Data registry</t>
             <t>The Call-Info header field MAY be 
either solely to reference the crash data (and 
hence have only the one URL) or may also contain 
other URLs referencing other data</t>
             </list>
             </t>
         <t>Additional crash data sets MAY be 
included by following the same steps</t>
     </list>
</t> 

<t>The Vehicle Emergency Data Set (VEDS) is an 
XML structure defined by the Association of 
Public-Safety Communications Officials (APCO) and 
the National Emergency Number Association (NENA) 
<xref target="VEDS"/>. The 
'application/emergencyCall.VEDS+xml' MIME 
content-type is used to identify it. The 'VEDS' 
entry in the Emergency Call Additional Data 
registry is used to construct a 'purpose' 
parameter value for conveying VEDS data in a 
Call-Info header.</t>

<t>The VEDS data is attached as a body part with 
MIME content type 
'application/emergencyCall.VEDS+xml' which is 
pointed at by a Call-Info URL of type CID with a 
'purpose' parameter of 
'emergencyCallData.VEDS'.</t>

<t>Entities along the path between the vehicle 
and the PSAP are able to identify the call as an 
ACN call and handle it appropriately.  The PSAP 
is able to identify the crash data as well as any 
other additional data attached to the INVITE by 
examining the Call-Info header fields for 
'purpose' parameters whose values start with 
'emergencyCallData.'  The PSAP is able to access 
and the data it is capable of handling and is 
interested in by checking the 'purpose' parameter 
values.</t>

</section>


<section anchor="routing" title="Call Routing">

     <t>An Emergency Services IP Network (ESInet) 
is a network operated by emergency services 
authorities.  It handles emergency call routing 
and processing before delivery to a PSAP.  In the 
NG9-1-1 architecture adopted by NENA as well as 
the NG1-1-2 architecture adopted by EENA, each 
PSAP is connected to one or more ESInets.  Each 
originating network is also connected to one or 
more ESInets.  The ESInets maintain policy-based 
routing rules which control the routing and 
processing of emergency calls.  The 
centralization of such rules within ESInets 
provides for a cleaner separation between the 
responsibilities of the originating network and 
that of the emergency services network, and 
provides greater flexibility and control over 
processing of emergency calls by the emergency 
services authorities.  This makes it easier to 
react quickly to unusual situations that require 
changes in how emergency calls are routed or 
handled (e.g., a natural disaster closes a PSAP), 
as well as ease in making long-term changes that 
affect such routing (e.g., cooperative agreements 
to specially handle calls requiring translation 
or relay services).</t>

     <t>In an environment that uses ESInets, the 
originating network need only detect that the 
service URN of an emergency call is or starts 
with "sos", passing all types of emergency calls 
to an ESInet.  The ESInet is then responsible for 
routing such calls to an appropriate PSAP.  In an 
environment without an ESInet, the emergency 
services authorities and the originating carriers 
would need to determine how such calls are 
routed.</t>

</section>

<section anchor="test-calls" title="Test Calls">

     <t>This specification also inherits the 
ability to utilize test call functionality from 
Section 15 of <xref target="RFC6881"/>.</t>

    <t hangText="Test Call Indication">A service 
URN starting with "test." indicates a request for 
an automated test. For example,
    "urn:service:test.sos.vehicle.automatic" 
indicates such a test feature. This functionality 
is defined in <xref target="RFC6881"/>.</t>

</section>



     <section anchor="example" title="Example">
       <t>
         <xref target="fig1"/> shows an emergency 
call placed by a vehicle whereby location
         information and VEDS crash data are both 
attached to the SIP INVITE message. The INVITE 
has a request URI containing the 
'urn:service:sos.vehicle.automatic' service URN 
and is
         thus recognized as an ACN type of 
emergency call, and is also recognized as a type 
of emergency call because the request URI starts 
with 'urn:service:sos'.  The
         mobile network operator (MNO) routes the 
call to an Emergency services IP Network 
(ESInet), as for any emergency call.  The ESInet 
processes the call as an ACN and routes the call 
to an appropriate ACN-capable PSAP (using 
location information and the fact that that it is 
an ACN).  (In deployments where there is no 
ESInet, the MNO itself needs to route directly to 
an appropriate ACN-capable PSAP.)
         The call is processed by the Emergency 
Services Routing Proxy (ESRP), as the entry point 
to the ESInet. The ESRP routes the call to an 
appropriate ACN-capable PSAP, where the call is 
received by a call taker. </t>
