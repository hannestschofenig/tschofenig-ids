      <t>This document describes how to re-use the emergency services mechanisms specified for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) 
	  to accomplishing emergency calling support in vehicles. Profiling and simplifications are possible due to the
        nature of the functionality that is going to be provided in vehicles with the usage of Global Positioning System (GPS).</t>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>Emergency calls made from vehicles can assist with the objective of significantly reducing
        road deaths and injuries. Unfortunately, drivers often have a poor location-awareness,
        especially on urban roads (also during night) and abroad. In the most crucial cases, the
        victim(s) may not be able to call because they have been injured or trapped.</t>

      <t>In Europe the European Commission has launched the 'eCall' initiative that may best be
        described as a user-initiated or automatically triggered system to provide notifications to
        Public Safety Answering Point's (PSAP), by means of cellular communications, that a vehicle
        has crashed, and to provide geodetic location information and where possible a voice channel
        to the PSAP.</t> 


<t>This document registers the 'application/emergencyCall.VEDS+xml' MIME content-type, and registers the 'VEDS' entry in the Emergency Call Additional Data registry.</t>

<t>VEDS is an XML structure defined by APCO/NENA. The 'application/emergencyCall.VEDS+xml' MIME content-type is used to identify it.  The 'VEDS' entry in the Emergency Call Additional Data registry is used to construct a 'purpose' parameter value for conveying VEDS data in a Call-Info header.</t>


<t>Circuit-switched eCall systems transmit crash data as a defined set, the Minimum Set of Data (MSD) <xref target="eCall-MSD"/>.  The MSD for circuit-switched eCall is a binary format defined by CEN,  the European Committee for Standardization.  It is expected that CEN will choose to define the XML schema for the eCall MSD for use in next-generation systems. Once this done, a MIME content-type (e.g., 'application/emergencyCall.eCall.MSD+xml') and Emergency Call Additional Data entry (e.g., 'eCall.MSD') need to be registered for the MSD. Note that <xref target="msd"/> explains how the functionality available in IETF specifications maps to the functionality required for the MSD of the mobile circuit switched voice solution.</t>

<t>CEN and/or other entities may define additional sets of data in the same manor: a standardized format, such as XML, is defined, and a MIME content-type and Emergency Call Additional Data entry registered.</t>

<t>An IVS system transmits crash data by encoding it in one of the standardized and registered formats (such as VEDS or eCall.MSD) and attaching it to an INVITE as a data block.  The block is identified by its MIME content-type, and pointed to by a CID URL in a Call-Info header with a 'purpose' parameter value corresponding to the block.</t>

		
<t>Current (circuit-switched or legacy) systems for placing emergency calls from vehicles, including automatic crash notification system, generally use one of three architectural models: TSP, direct, and paired handset. These three models are illustrated below.</t>

<t>In the TSP model the TSP operator communicates location and crash data to PSAP verbally.

        <figure anchor="tsp-model" title="TSP Model.">

]]></artwork>
        </figure>
      </t>



<t>In the paired model the IVS communicates location data to PSAP via text-to-speech; no
crash data.

        <figure anchor="paired-model" title="Paired Model">
          <artwork><![CDATA[

]]></artwork>
        </figure>
      </t>

<t>In the direct model the IVS communicates location and crash data to PSAP via eCall
in-band modem in voice call.
        <figure anchor="direct-model" title="Direct Model">
          <artwork><![CDATA[

]]></artwork>
        </figure>
      </t>

<t>The migration to next-generation (all-IP) would then look like as follows.
In the TSP model the TSP transmits crash data using Internet protocols.
        <figure anchor="tsp-model2" title="TSP Model">

]]></artwork>
        </figure>
      </t>
	  
<t>In the paired model, the IVS uses a Bluetooth link to a
previously-paired handset to establish an emergency call with the PSAP;
it is not clear what facilities are or will be available for
transmitting crash data.

<t>This document is focused on the interface to the PSAP, that is, how an emergency call (including location and crash data) is setup and data is transmitted to the PSAP using existing IETF
specifications. The goal is to re-use existing specifications rather than to invent new. For the direct model (such as the European eCall), this is the
end-to-end description.  For the TSP model, this describes the
right-hand side, leaving the left-hand side up to the entities involved
(e.g., IVS and TSP vendors) who are then free to use the same mechanism
as for the right-hand side or not.</t>

    <section anchor="data-profile" title="Profile">
      <t>In the context of emergncy calls placed from a vehicle it is assumed that the car is equipped with a built-in GPS receiver. 
	  For this reason only geodetic location information will
        be sent within an emergency call. The following location shapes MUST be implemented: 2d and 3d Point (see
        Section 5.2.1 of <xref target="RFC5491"/>), Circle (see Section
        5.2.3 of <xref target="RFC5491"/>), and Ellipsoid (see Section
        5.2.7 of <xref target="RFC5491"/>). The coordinate reference
        systems (CRS) specified in <xref target="RFC5491"/> are also
        mandatory for this document. The &lt;direction&gt; element, as defined in <xref target="RFC5962"/> which indicates the direction of travel of the vehicle, is
        important for dispatch and hence it MUST be included in the PIDF-LO . The
        &lt;heading&gt; element specified in <xref
          target="RFC5962"/> MUST be implemented and MAY be included. </t>
		  
	<t>This specification also inherits the ability to utilize test call functionality from Section 15 of <xref target="RFC6881"/>.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="example" title="Example">
      <t>
        <xref target="fig1"/> shows an emergency call placed from a vehicle whereby location
        information information is directly attached to the SIP INVITE message itself. The call is
        marked as an emergency call using the 'urn:service:sos.ecall.automatic' service URN and the PSAP of the
        VoIP provider determines which PSAP to contact based on the provided location information.
        The emergency
        call continues towards the PSAP and in this example it hits the ESRP, as the entry point to
        the PSAP operators emergency services network. Finally, the emergency call will be received
        by a call taker and first reponders will be dispatched. </t>

  <section anchor="msd" title="Matching Functionality with eCall Minimum Set of Data (MSD)">
  <t><xref target="eCall-MSD"/> outlines a number of data elements that are transmitted in an emergency call triggered by a vehicle. Note that the work on eCall for mobile circuit switched voice is constrained in a number of ways since legacy eCall uses an inband voice modem for backwards compatibility with the already deployed cellular infrastructure to transmit data from a vehicle to a PSAP. Since the functionality in this document is based on the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) these limitations do not exist. As such, it is not useful to transmit the MSD inband in the voice channel but to rather use the SIP mechanisms standardized for emergency call handling. Any voice, video, or real-text communication will be negotiated using the Session Description Protocol (SDP), as shown in <xref target="fig2"/>, and the actual media stream will then take place in RTP packets. For transmitting location information an XML-based data structure had been defined, the so-called Presence Information Data Format Location Object (PIDF-LO). </t> 
  
  <t>The following list compares the eCall minimum set of data with the functionality provided in this document.
  <list style="hanging">
   <t hangText="Version of the MSD Format:">Conveying information in a SIP-based emergency call is accomplished by using XML payloads and XML provides namespace declarations that allow a receipient of that information to distinguish different versions and additional extensions. For example, if additional data about a vehicle is defined and can be 
   transmitted by vehicle then a respective extension can be defined inside the additional data XML structure <xref target="I-D.ietf-ecrit-additional-data"/>. Selecting the appropriate extension point depends on the type of extension envisioned.</t> 
   <t hangText="Message Identifier:">Every SIP INVITE message contains a Call-ID, which is a globally unique identifier for this call.</t>
   <t hangText="Vehicle Type Encoding:">[Editor's Note: Description to be added.].</t>
   <t hangText="Test Call Indication">A service URN starting with "test." indicates a request for an automated test. For example,
   "urn:service:test.sos.ecall.automatic" indicates such a test feature. This functionality is defined in <xref target="RFC6881"/>.</t>
   <t hangText="Automatic Activation Indication:">This document registers new service URNs, which allow the differentiation between manually and automatically triggered emergency calls. The two service URNs are: urn:service:sos.ecall.automatic and urn:service:sos.ecall.manual</t>
   <t hangText="Vehicle Identification:">The PIDF data structure contains a deviceID field that holds the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN).</t>
   <t hangText="Vehicle Propulsion Storage type:"> These parameters identify the type of vehicle
energy storage(s) present. [Editor's Note: Description to be added.]</t>
   <t hangText="Timestamp of Incident Event:">The PIDF-LO element contains the timestamp when the PIDF-LO was created, which is at the time of the incident.</t>
   <t hangText="Vehicle Location:">The location of the vehicle is conveyed using the PIDF location objection, as described in <xref target="data-profile"/>.</t>
   <t hangText="Vehicle Direction:">The direction of the vehicle is part of location information, as described in <xref target="data-profile"/>.</t>
   <t hangText="Recent Vehicle Location:">With this optional functionality multiple location objects may be required to be transported simultaneously. This can be achieved using &lt;timed-presence&gt;, defined
   in RFC 4481 <xref target="RFC4481"/>.</t>
   <t hangText="Number of Passengers:">Minimum known number of fastened seatbelts. [Editor's Note: Description to be added.]</t>
   <t hangText="Additional Data:"><xref target="I-D.ietf-ecrit-additional-data"/> provides the ability to carry additional data for an emergency call.</t>
