                   Next-Generation Pan-European eCall
                    draft-gellens-ecrit-ecall-00.txt

Abstract

   This document describes how to use IP-based emergency services
   mechanisms to support the next generation of the Pan European in-
   vehicle emergency call service defined under the eSafety initiative
   of the European Commission (generally referred to as "eCall"). eCall
   is a standardized and mandated system for a special form of emergency
   calls placed by vehicles.  eCall deployment is required by 2015 in
   European Union member states, and eCall is also being deployed in
   other regions.  eCall provides an integrated voice path and a
   standardized set of vehicle, sensor (e.g., crash related), and
   location data.  An eCall is recognized and handled as a specialized
   form of emergency call and is routed to a specialized eCall-capable
   Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) capable of processing the
   vehicle data and trained in handling emergency calls from vehicles.
   Currently, eCall functions over circuit-switched cellular telephony;
   work on next-generation eCall (NG-eCall, sometimes called packet-
   switched eCall or PS-eCall) is now in process, and this document
   assists in that work by describing how to support eCall within the
   IP-based emergency services infrastructure.

   This document also registers a MIME Content Type and an Emergency
   Call Additional Data Block for the eCall vehicle data.

2.  Document Scope

   This document is limited to the signaling, data exchange, and
   protocol needs of next-generation eCall (NG-eCall, also referred to
   as packet-switched eCall (PS-eCall) and all-IP eCall).  eCall itself
   is specified by 3GPP and CEN and these specifications include far
   greater scope than is covered here.

3.  Introduction

   Emergency calls made from vehicles (e.g., in the event of a crash)
   assist in significantly reducing road deaths and injuries by allowing
   emergency services to be aware of the incident, the state of the
   vehicle, the location of the vehicle, and to have a voice channel
   with the vehicle occupants.  This enables a quick and appropriate
   response.

   The European Commission initiative of eCall was conceived in the late
   1990s, and has evolved to a European Parliament decision requiring
   the implementation of compliant in-vehicle systems (IVS) in new
   vehicles and the deployment of eCall in the European Member States in
   2015.  eCall is also being adopted in other regions.

   The pan-European eCall system provides a standardized and mandated
   mechanism for emergency calls by vehicles.  eCall establishes
   procedures for such calls to be placed by in-vehicle systems,
   recognized and processed by the network, and routed to a specialized
   PSAP where the vehicle data is available to assist the call taker in
   assessing and responding to the situation.  eCall provides a standard
   set of vehicle, sensor (e.g., crash related), and location data.

Internet-Draft            Next-Generation eCall             October 2013


   An eCall may be either user-initiated or automatically triggered.
   Automatically triggered eCalls indicate a car crash or some other
   serious incident (e.g., a fire) and carry a greater presumption of
   risk of injury.  Manually triggered eCalls may be reports of serious
   hazards and are likely to require a different response than an
   automatically triggered eCall.  Manually triggered eCalls are also
   more likely to be false (e.g., accidental) calls and may thus be
   subject to different handling by the PSAP.

   Currently, eCall is standardized (by 3GPP [SDO-3GPP] and CEN [CEN])
   as a 3GPP circuit-switched call over GSM (2G) or UMTS (3G).  An eCall
   flag in the call setup marks the call as an eCall, and further
   indicates if the call was automatically or manually triggered.  The
   call is routed to an eCall-capable PSAP, a voice channel is
   established between the vehicle and the PSAP, and an eCall in-band
   modem is used to carry a defined set of vehicle, sensor (e.g., crash
   related), and location data (the Minimum Set of Data or MSD) within
   the voice channel.  The same in-band mechanism is used for the PSAP
   to acknowledge successful receipt of the MSD, and optionally to
   request the vehicle to send a new MSD (e.g., to check if the state of
   or location of the vehicle or its occupants has changed).  Work on
   next-generation eCall (NG-eCall, also referred to as packet-switched
   eCall or PS eCall) is now in process.  NG-eCall moves from circuit
   switched to all-IP, and carries the vehicle data and other eCall-
   specific data as additional data associated with the call.  This
   document describes how IETF mechanisms are used to provide the
   signaling and data exchange of the next generation of pan-European
   eCall.

4.  eCall Requirements

   Overall eCall requirements are specified by by by CEN in [EN_16072]
   and by 3GPP in [TS22.101] clauses 10.7 and A.27.  Requirements
   specific to vehicle data are contained in EN 15722 [msd].  For
   convenience, the requirements most applicable to the limited scope of
   this document are summarized very briefly below.

   eCall requires:

   o  The call be recognized as an eCall (which is inherently an
      emergency call)
   o  The call setup indicates if the call was manually or automatically
      triggered
   o  A voice channel between the vehicle and the PSAP
   o  Carrying the MSD intrinsically with the call (the MSD needs to be
      available to the same call-taker as the voice)
   o  The ability for the PSAP to acknowledge receipt of the MSD

Internet-Draft            Next-Generation eCall             October 2013


   o  The ability for the PSAP to request that the vehicle generate and
      transmit a new MSD
   o  The ability of the PSAP to be able to re-contact the occupants of
      vehicle after the initial eCall is concluded
   o  The ability to perform a test call (which may be routed to a PSAP
      but is not treated as a real call and not handled by a call taker)

   It is recognized that NG-eCall offers many potential enhancements,
   although these are not required by current EU regulations.  For
   convenience, the enhancements most applicable to the limited scope of
   this document are summarized very briefly below.

   NG-eCall is expected to offer:

   o  The ability to carry more data (e.g., an enhanced MSD or an MSD
      plus additional sets of data)
   o  The ability to handle video
   o  The ability to handle text
   o  The ability for the PSAP to access vehicle components (e.g., an
      onboard camera (such as rear facing or blind-spot cameras) for a
      visual assessment of the crash site situation)
   o  The ability for the PSAP to request the vehicle to take actions
      (e.g., sound the horn, disable the ignition, lock/unlock doors)
   o  The ability to avoid audio muting of the voice channel (because
      the MSD is not transferred using an in-band modem)

5.  Vehicle Data

   Pan-European eCall provides a standardized and mandated set of
   vehicle related data, known as the Minimum Set of Data (MSD).  The
   European Committee for Standardization (CEN) has specified this data
   in EN 15722 [msd], along with both ASN.1 and XML encodings for the
   MSD [msd].  Circuit-switched eCall uses the ASN.1 encoding (due to
   its more compact size).  The XML encoding is better suited for use in
   SIP messages and is used in this document.  (The ASN.1 encoding is
   specified in Annex A of EN 15722 [msd], while the XML encoding is
   specified in Annex C.)

   The "Additional Data related to an Emergency Call" document
   [additional-data-draft] establishes a general mechanism for attaching
   blocks of data to a SIP emergency call.  This document makes use of
   that mechanism to carry the eCall MSD in a SIP emergency call.

Internet-Draft            Next-Generation eCall             October 2013


   This document registers the 'application/
   emergencyCall.eCall.MSD+xml') MIME Content-Type to enable the MSD to
   be carried in SIP.  This document also adds the 'eCall.MSD' entry to
   the Emergency Call Additional Data Blocks registry (established by
   [additional-data-draft]) to enable the MSD to be recognized as such
   in a SIP-based eCall emergency call.

6.  Call Setup

   In circuit-switched eCall, the IVS places a special form of a 112
   emergency call which carries the eCall flag (indicating that the call
   is an eCall and also if the call was manually or automatically
   triggered); the mobile network operator (MNO) recognizes the eCall
   flag and routes the call to an eCall-capable PSAP; vehicle data is
   transmitted to the PSAP via the eCall in-band modem (in the voice
   channel).

      ///----\\\      112 voice call with eCall flag
   +------+
     ||| IVS  |||---------------------------------------->+
   PSAP |
      \\\----///   vehicle data via eCall in-band modem
   +------+


                     Figure 1: circuit-switched eCall

   An In-Vehicle System (IVS) which supports NG-eCall transmits the MSD
   in accordance with [additional-data-draft] by encoding it as
   specified (per Appendix C of EN 15722 [msd]) and attaching it to an
   INVITE as a MIME body part.  The body part is identified by its MIME
   content-type 'application/emergencyCall.eCall.MSD+xml') in the
   Content-Type header field of the body part.  The body part is
   assigned a unique identifier which is listed in a Content-ID header
   field in the body part.  The INVITE is marked as containing the MSD
   by adding (or appending to) a Call-Info header field at the top level
   of the INVITE.  This Call-Info header field contains a CID URL
   referencing the body part's unique identifier, and a 'purpose'
   parameter identifying the data as the eCall MSD per the registry
   entry; the 'purpose' parameter's value is 'emergencyCallData.' and
   the root of the MIME type (not including the 'emergencyCall' prefix
   and any suffix such as '+xml'
   ('purpose=emergencyCallData.eCall.MSD').

   For NG-eCall, the IVS establishes an emergency call using the 3GPP
   IMS solution with a Request-URI indicating an eCall type of emergency
   call and with vehicle data attached; the MNO or ESInet recognizes the
   eCall URN and routes the call to a NG-eCall capable PSAP; the PSAP

   interpets the vehicle data sent with the call and makes it available
   to the call taker.

                            Figure 2: NG-eCall

   This document registers new service URN children within the "sos"
   subservice.  These URNs provide the mechanism by which an eCall is
   identified, and differentiate between manually and automatically
   triggered eCalls (which may be subject to different treatment,
   depending on policy).  The two service URNs are:
   urn:service:sos.ecall.automatic and urn:service:sos.ecall.manual

7.  Call Routing

   The routing rules for eCalls are likely to differ from those of other
   emergency calls because eCalls are special types of emergency calls
   (with implications for the types of response required) and need to be
   handled by specially designated PSAPs.  In an environment that uses
   ESInets, the originating network passes all types of emergency calls
   to an ESInet (which have a request URI containing the "SOS" service
   URN).  The ESInet is then responsible for routing such calls to the
   appropriate PSAP.  In an environment without an ESInet, the emergency
   services authorities and the originating network jointly determine
   how such calls are routed.

7.1.  ESInets

   This section provides background information on ESInets for
   information only.

   An Emergency Services IP Network (ESInet) is a network operated by
   emergency services authorities.  It handles emergency call routing
   and processing before delivery to a PSAP.  In the NG1-1-2
   architecture adopted by EENA, each PSAP is connected to one or more
   ESInets.  Each originating network is also connected to one or more
   ESInets.  The ESInets maintain policy-based routing rules which
   control the routing and processing of emergency calls.  The
   centralization of such rules within ESInets provides for a cleaner
   separation between the responsibilities of the originating network
   and that of the emergency services network, and provides greater
   flexibility and control over processing of emergency calls by the



Gellens & Tschofenig     Expires April 26, 2014                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft            Next-Generation eCall             October 2013


   emergency services authorities.  This makes it easier to react
   quickly to unusual situations that require changes in how emergency
   calls are routed or handled (e.g., a natural disaster closes a PSAP),
   as well as ease in making long-term changes that affect such routing
   (e.g., cooperative agreements to specially handle calls requiring
   translation or relay services).  ESInets may support the ability to
   interwork NG-eCall to legacy eCall to handle eCall-capable PSAPs that
   are not IP PSAPs (similarly to the ability to interwork IP emergency
   calls to legacy non-IP PSAPs).  Note that in order to support legacy
   eCall-capable PSAPs that are not IP PSAPs and are not attached to an
   ESInet, an originating network may need the ability to route an eCall
   itself (e.g., to an interworking facility with interconnection to a
   suitable legacy eCall capable PSAP) based on the eCall and manual or
   automatic indications.

8.  Test Calls

   eCall requires the ability to place test calls.  These are calls that
   are recognized and treated as eCalls but are not given emergency call
   treatment and are not handled by call takers.

   A service URN starting with "test." indicates a test call.  For
   example, "urn:service:test.sos.ecall.automatic" indicates such a test
   feature.  This functionality is defined in [RFC6881].

   This document registers "urn:service:test.sos.ecall.automatic" and
   "urn:service:test.sos.ecall.manual" for eCall test calls.

9.  eCall-Specific Data from PSAP to IVS

   eCall requires the ability for the PSAP to acknowledge successful
   receipt of the MSD, and for the PSAP to optionally request that the
   IVS send a new MSD (e.g., if the call taker wishes to see if the
   vehicle's state or location has changed).  Future enhancements are
   desired, for example, to enable the PSAPto send other requests to the
   vehicle, such as starting a video stream from on-board cameras (such
   as rear focus or blind-spot), locking or unlocking doors, sounding
   the horn, flashing the lights, etc.

   The same mechanism established in [additional-data-draft], used in
   this document to carry the MSD from the IVS to the PSAP, can be used
   to carry a control data block from the PSAP to the IVS.  This eCall
   control block (also referred to as eCall metadata) is an XML
   structure containing eCall-specific elements.  When the PSAP needs to
   send an eCall control block that is in response to the MSD or other
   data sent by the IVS, the control block can be sent in the SIP
   response to the message containing the MSD or other data (e.g., the
   INVITE).  When the PSAP needs to send an eCall control block that is



Gellens & Tschofenig     Expires April 26, 2014                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft            Next-Generation eCall             October 2013


   not an immediate response to an MSD or other data sent by the IVS,
   the control block can be transmitted from the PSAP to the IVS in a
   SIP INFO message within the established session.  This creates a
   framework mechanism by which the PSAP can send eCall-specific data to
   the IVS.  When the control data requests the IVS to send a new MSD or
   other data block, the IVS can do so in an INFO message within the
   session (it could also use re-INVITE but that is unnecessary when no
   aspect of the session or media is changing).

   This mechanism requires

   o  An XML definition of the eCall control object
   o  An extension mechanism by which new elements can be added to the
      control object definition
   o  A MIME type registration for the control object (so it can be
      carried in SIP messages and responses)
   o  An entry in the Emergency Call Additional Data Blocks sub-registry
      (established by [additional-data-draft]) so that the control block
      can be recognized as emergency call specific data within the SIP
      messages
   o  An Info-Package registration per [RFC6086] permitting the control
      block within Info messages

10.  Example

   Figure 3 shows an eCall.  The call uses the request URI
   'urn:service:sos.ecall.automatic' service URN and is recognized as an
   eCall, and further as one that was invoked automatically by the IVS
   due to a crash or other serious incident.  In this example, the
   originating network routes the call to an ESInet (as for any
   emergency call in an environment with an ESInet).  The ESInet routes
   the call to the appropriate NG-eCall capable PSAP.  (In deployments
   where there is no ESInet, the originating network routes the call
   directly to the appropriate NG-eCall capable PSAP.)  The emergency
   call is received by the ESInet's Emergency Services Routing Proxy
   (ESRP), as the entry point to the ESInet.  The ESRP routes the call
   to a PSAP, where it is received by a call taker.

11.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations described in [RFC5069] apply here.

   An eCall will carry two forms of location data: the network-provided
   location that is inherently part of IMS emergency calls (which may be
   determined in cooperation with or possibly entirely by the
   originating device), and the IVS-supplied location within the MSD.
   This is likely to be useful to the PSAP, especially when the two
   locations are independently determined.  The document
   [I-D.ietf-ecrit-trustworthy-location] discusses trust issues
   regarding location provided by or determined in cooperation with end
   devices.

   The mechanism by which the PSAP sends acknowledgment and optional
   requests to the vehicle requires authenticity considerations; when
   the PSAP request is received within an established session initiated
   by the vehicle as an eCall emergency call, there is a higher degree

Internet-Draft            Next-Generation eCall             October 2013


   of trust that the source is indeed a PSAP.  If the PSAP request is
   received in other situations, such as a call-back, the trust issues
   in verifying that a call-back is indeed from a PSAP apply (see the
   PSAP Callback document [I-D.ietf-ecrit-psap-callback]).

12.  IANA Considerations

12.1.  Service URN Registration

   IANA is requested to register the URN 'urn:service:sos.ecall' under
   the sub-services 'sos' registry defined in Section 4.2 of [RFC5031].

   This service identifies a type of emergency call (placed by a
   specialized in-vehicle system and carrying standardized set of data
   related to the vehicle and crash or incident, and is needed to direct
   the call to a specialized public safety answering point (PSAP) with
   technical and operational capabilities to handle such calls.  Two
   sub-services are registered as well, namely

   urn:service:sos.ecall.manual

      This service URN indicates that an eCall had been triggered based
      on the manual interaction of the driver or a passenger.

   urn:service:sos.ecall.automatic

      This service URN indicates that an eCall had been triggered
      automatically, for example, due to a crash or other serious
      incident (e.g., fire).

   IANA is also requested to register the URN
   'urn:service:test.sos.ecall' under the sub-service 'test' registry
   defined in Setcion 17.2 of [RFC6881].  Two sub-services are
   registered as well, namely 'urn:service:test.sos.ecall.automatic' and
   'urn:service:test.sos.ecall.manual'.

12.2.  MIME Content-type Registration for 'application/
       emergencyCall.eCall.MSD+xml'

   This specification requests the registration of a new MIME type
   according to the procedures of RFC 4288 [RFC4288] and guidelines in
   RFC 3023 [RFC3023].

      MIME media type name: application

      MIME subtype name: emergencyCall.eCall.MSD+xml

      Mandatory parameters: none

      Optional parameters: charset

      Indicates the character encoding of the XML content.

      Encoding considerations: Uses XML, which can employ 8-bit
      characters, depending on the character encoding used.  See
      Section 3.2 of RFC 3023 [RFC3023].

      Security considerations: This content type is designed to carry
      vehicle and incident-related data during an emergency call.  This
      data contains personal information including vehicle VIN,
      location, direction, etc.  Appropriate precautions need to be
      taken to limit unauthorized access, inappropriate disclosure to
      third parties, and eavesdropping of this information.  In general,
      it is permissible for the data to be unprotected while briefly in
      transit within the Mobile Network Operator (MNO); the MNO is
      trusted to not permit the data to be accessed by third parties.
      Sections 7 and Section 8 of [I-D.ietf-ecrit-additional-data]
      contain more discussion.

      Interoperability considerations: None

      Published specification: Annex C of EN 15722 [msd]

      Applications which use this media type: Pan-European eCall
      compliant systems

      Additional information: None

      Magic Number: None

      File Extension: .xml

      Macintosh file type code: 'TEXT'

12.3.  Registration of the 'eCall.MSD' entry in the Emergency Call
       Additional Data Blocks registry

   This specification requests IANA to add the 'eCall.MSD' entry to the
   Emergency Call Additional Data Blocks registry (established by
   [additional-data-draft]), with a reference to this document.
