    <abstract>


<t>The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) has been designed with TCP as an underlying
transport protocol. The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), which has
been inspired by HTTP, has on the other hand been defined to make use of
UDP. Therefore, reliable delivery and a simple congestion control and flow control mechanism
are provided by the message layer of the CoAP protocol.</t>

<t>A number of environments benefit from the use of CoAP directly over a
reliable byte stream that already provides these services.
This document defines the use of CoAP over TCP as well as CoAP over TLS.</t>

<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">

<t>The Internet protocol stack is organized in layers, namely link layer,
internet layer, transport layer, and the application layer
(<xref target="RFC1122"/>).</t>

<t>IP emerged as the waist of the hour glass and supports a variety of
link layers and new link layer technologies can be added in the
future, without affecting IP.</t>

<t>Combined with the end-to-end principle, the hour glass indicates the
level of protocol understanding that intermediaries need to have in order
to forward IP packets between a sender and a receiver (absent
any specific application layer entities, such as proxies or caches).
Having IP as the waist means that anyone can extend the layers above
the network layer in the way they want to communicate end-to-end,
including defining new transport layer protocols (as it was done with
SCTP <xref target="RFC4960"/>, and DCCP <xref target="RFC4340"/>)
  <cref anchor="_3" source="cabo">Do we really need all this verbiage?</cref>.</t>

<t>Unfortunately, some network deployments depart from this architecture.
The <xref target="RFC7252">Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)</xref> was designed
for Internet of Things (IoT) deployments, assuming that UDP can be
used freely – UDP <xref target="RFC0768"/>, or DTLS <xref target="RFC6347"/> over UDP, is a good choice for
transferring small amounts of data in networks that follow the IP
architecture.
Some CoAP deployments, however, may have to integrate well with
existing enterprise infrastructure, where the use of UDP-based
protocols may not be well-received or even supported by firewalls.
Middleboxes that are unaware of the IoT can make the use of UDP
brittle.</t>

<t>As a separate consideration, some environments benefit from the more advanced congestion
control and flow control capabilities provided by TCP.  For instance,
CoAP back-end processors in a cloud environment may want to connect
between each other via TCP instead of UDP; a TCP-to-UDP gateway can be
used at the cloud boundary to talk to the UDP-based IoT.</t>

<t>To make both IoT devices and their associated back-end processors work
smoothly in these demanding environments, CoAP needs
to make use of a different transport protocol, namely TCP
<xref target="RFC0793"/> and in some situations even TLS <xref target="RFC5246"/>.</t>

<t>The present document
document describes a shim header that conveys length information about
each CoAP message included.  Modifications to CoAP beyond the replacement of
the message layer
(e.g., to introduce further optimizations) are intentionally avoided.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="terminology" title="Terminology">

<t>The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”,
“SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “NOT RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and
“OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="constrained-application-protocol" title="Constrained Application Protocol">

<t>The interaction model of CoAP over TCP is very similar to the one for
CoAP over UDP with the key difference that TCP voids the need to
provide certain transport layer protocol features, such as reliable
delivery, fragmentation and reassembly, as well as congestion control,
at the CoAP level. The protocol stack is illustrated in <xref target="stack"/> (derived
from <xref target="RFC7252"/>, Figure 1).</t>

<t>TCP offers features that are not available in UDP and consequently
have been provided in CoAP’s message layer. The first mechanism that
can be omitted is the concept of ACKs in CoAP.  Since TCP offers
reliable delivery, there is no need to offer a redundant
acknowledgement at the CoAP messaging layer.</t>

<t>Hence, the only message type supported when using CoAP over TCP is
the Non-confirmable message (NON).  By nature of TCP, a NON over TCP is still transmitted
reliably. <xref target="NON"/> (derived from <xref target="RFC7252"/>, Figure 3) shows this
message exchange graphically.  A UDP-to-TCP gateway will therefore discard all
empty messages such as empty ACKs (after operating on them at the
message layer) and re-pack the contents of all non-empty CON, NON, or
ACK messages (i.e., those ACK messages that have a piggy-backed
response) into NON messages.</t>

<t>Similarly, there is no need to detect duplicate delivery of a message.
In UDP CoAP, the Message ID is used for relating acknowledgements to
Confirmable messages as well as for duplicate detection.
Since the Message ID thus is not meaningful over TCP, it is elided (as indicated by the
dashes in <xref target="NON"/>).</t>

<figure title="NON Message Transmission over TCP." anchor="NON"><artwork><![CDATA[

<t>As a result of removing the message layer in CoAP over TCP, the only supported message type
from the ones CoAP over UDP provides is the NON type. A response is sent back as defined
in <xref target="RFC7252"/>, as
illustrated in <xref target="NON2"/> (derived from <xref target="RFC7252"/>, Figure 6).</t>

<section anchor="message-format" title="Message Format">

<t>The CoAP message format defined in <xref target="RFC7252"/>, as shown in
<xref target="CoAP-Header"/>, relies on the datagram transport (UDP, or DTLS over
UDP) for keeping the individual messages separate.</t>

<t>In a stream oriented transport protocol such as TCP, some other form
of delimiting messages is needed.  For this purpose, CoAP over TCP
introduces a length field.  <xref target="Shim"/> shows the 2-byte shim header
carrying length information prepending the CoAP message header.</t>

<t>The ‘Message Length’ field is a 16-bit unsigned integer in network
byte order. It provides the length of the subsequent CoAP message
(including the CoAP header but excluding this message length field) in
bytes.  T is always the code for NON (1).  The Message ID is
meaningless and thus elided.  The semantics of the other CoAP header
fields is left unchanged.</t>

<section anchor="discussion" title="Discussion">

<t>One might wish that,
when CoAP is used over TLS, then the TLS record layer length field
could be used in place of the shim header length.  Each CoAP message would be transported in a
separate TLS record layer message, making the shim header that includes the
length information redundant.</t>

<t>However,
    RFC 5246 says: »Client
   message boundaries are not preserved in the record layer (i.e.,
   multiple client messages of the same ContentType MAY be coalesced
   into a single TLSPlaintext record, or a single message MAY be
   fragmented across several records).«, and TLS implementations
   typically do not support an interface that would provide access to
   the record layer delimiting information.
An additional problem with this approach is that this approach would remove the
potential optimization of packing several CoAP messages into one
record layer message, which is normally a way to amortize the record layer and MAC overhead
over all these messages.</t>

<t>In summary, we are not pursuing this idea for an optimization.</t>

<t>One other observation is that the message size limitations defined in
Section 4.6 of <xref target="RFC7252"/> are no longer strictly necessary.
Consenting [how?] implementations may want to interchange messages
with payload sizes than 1024 bytes, potentially also obviating the
need for the Block protocol <xref target="I-D.ietf-core-block"/>.  It must be noted that
entirely getting rid of the block protocol is
not a generally applicable solution, as:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>a UDP-to-TCP gateway may simply not have the context to convert a
message with a Block option into the equivalent exchange without any
use of a Block option.</t>
  <t>large messages might also cause undesired head-of-line blocking.</t>
</list></t>

<t>The general assumption is therefore that the block protocol will
continue to be used over TCP, even if applications occasionally do
exchange messages with payload sizes larger than desirable in UDP.</t>

<section anchor="URI" title="CoAP URI">

<t>CoAP <xref target="RFC7252"/> defines the “coap” and “coaps” URI schemes for
identifying CoAP resources and providing a means of locating the
resource. RFC 7252 defines these resources for use with CoAP over UDP.</t>

<t>The present specification introduces two new URI schemes, namely “coap+tcp”
and “coaps+tcp”.  The rules from Section 6 of <xref target="RFC7252"/> apply to
these two new URI schemes.</t>

<t><xref target="RFC7252"/>, Section 8 (Multicast CoAP), does not apply to the URI
schemes defined in the present specification.</t>

<t>Resources made available via one of the “coap+tcp” or “coaps+tcp” schemes
   have no shared identity with the other scheme or with the “coap” or
   “coaps” scheme, even if their resource identifiers indicate the
   same authority (the same host listening to the same port).
   The schemes constitute distinct namespaces and, in combination with
   the authority, are considered to be distinct
   origin servers.</t>

<t>The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a specialized web transfer protocol for use with constrained nodes and constrained (e.g., low-power, lossy) networks. The nodes often have 8-bit microcontrollers with small amounts of ROM and RAM, while constrained networks such as IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPANs) often have high packet error rates and a typical throughput of 10s of kbit/s. The protocol is designed for machine- to-machine (M2M) applications such as smart energy and building automation.&lt;/t>&lt;t> CoAP provides a request/response interaction model between application endpoints, supports built-in discovery of services and resources, and includes key concepts of the Web such as URIs and Internet media types. CoAP is designed to easily interface with HTTP for integration with the Web while meeting specialized requirements such as multicast support, very low overhead, and simplicity for constrained environments.</t></abstract></front>

The DTLS protocol is based on the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol and provides equivalent security guarantees.  Datagram semantics of the underlying transport are preserved by the DTLS protocol.  This document updates DTLS 1.0 to work with TLS version 1.2. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t></abstract></front>

<title>Blockwise transfers in CoAP</title>

<abstract><t>CoAP is a RESTful transfer protocol for constrained nodes and networks.  Basic CoAP messages work well for the small payloads we expect from temperature sensors, light switches, and similar building-automation devices.  Occasionally, however, applications will need to transfer larger payloads -- for instance, for firmware updates.  With HTTP, TCP does the grunt work of slicing large payloads up into multiple packets and ensuring that they all arrive and are handled in the right order.  CoAP is based on datagram transports such as UDP or DTLS, which limits the maximum size of resource representations that can be transferred without too much fragmentation.  Although UDP supports larger payloads through IP fragmentation, it is limited to 64 KiB and, more importantly, doesn't really work well for constrained applications and networks.  Instead of relying on IP fragmentation, this specification extends basic CoAP with a pair of "Block" options, for transferring multiple blocks of information from a resource representation in multiple request-response pairs.  In many important cases, the Block options enable a server to be truly stateless: the server can handle each block transfer separately, with no need for a connection setup or other server-side memory of previous block transfers.  In summary, the Block options provide a minimal way to transfer larger representations in a block-wise fashion.</t></abstract>

<t>This document obsoletes RFC 2960 and RFC 3309. It describes the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP). SCTP is designed to transport Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) signaling messages over IP networks, but is capable of broader applications.&lt;/t>&lt;t> SCTP is a reliable transport protocol operating on top of a connectionless packet network such as IP. It offers the following services to its users:&lt;/t>&lt;t> -- acknowledged error-free non-duplicated transfer of user data,&lt;/t>&lt;t> -- data fragmentation to conform to discovered path MTU size,&lt;/t>&lt;t> -- sequenced delivery of user messages within multiple streams, with an option for order-of-arrival delivery of individual user messages,&lt;/t>&lt;t> -- optional bundling of multiple user messages into a single SCTP packet, and&lt;/t>&lt;t> -- network-level fault tolerance through supporting of multi-homing at either or both ends of an association.&lt;/t>&lt;t> The design of SCTP includes appropriate congestion avoidance behavior and resistance to flooding and masquerade attacks.
