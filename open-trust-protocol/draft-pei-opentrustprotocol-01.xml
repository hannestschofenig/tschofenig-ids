    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies the Open Trust Protocol (OTrP), a 
      protocol to install, update, and delete applications and to manage 
      security configuration in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE).</t> 

      <t>TEEs are used in environments where security services should be
       isolated from a regular operating system (often called rich OS). This form of compartmentlization 
grants a smaller codebase access to security sensitive services and restricts
communication from the rich OS to those security services via mediated access.</t>
    </abstract>

   <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>The Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) concept has been designed and used to
      increase security by separating regular operating systems, also referred as Rich Execution Environment (REE), from security-sensitive 
       applications. In an TEE ecosystem, a 
      Trust Service Manager (TSM) is used to authorize manage
      keys and the Trusted Applications (TA) that run in a device.
      Different device vendors may use different TEE implementations. Different
      application providers may use different TSM providers. There arises a
      need of an open interoperable protocol that allows trustworthy TSM to
      manage security domains and contents running in different Trusted Execution
      Environment (TEE) of various devices.</t>

      <t>The Open Trust Protocol (OTrP) defines a protocol between a
      TSM and a TEE and relies on IETF-defined end-to-end security mechanisms, namely 
      JSON Web Encryption (JWE), JSON Web Signature (JWS), and JSON Web Key (JWK).</t>

    <!--  <t>Some deployed TEE and TSM implementations use symmetric key cryptography
        as the underlying security foundation and rely on a centralized database
        that holds these keys for every device that uses a TEE. This specification 
        follows a different design approach and makes use of public key cryptography
        at the expensive of slower performance but improved security.         
      </t>
--> 

<!-- 
      <t>The OTrP protocol uses standard certificates as trust anchors and
        establishes mutual trust among device firmware, TEE, TSM, and service
        providers. Thus it doesn't bear the constraint and security risk that
        a central device key database would expose.
      </t>
--> 
      
      <t>This specification assumes that a device that utilizes this specification 
      is equipped with a TEE and is pre-provisioned with a device-unique public/private key pair, 
      which is securely stored. This key pair is referred as the 'root of trust'. 
      A Service Provider (SP) uses such a device to run
      Trusted Applications (TA).</t>
      
      
      <t>A security domain is defined as the TEE representation of a service
        provider and is a logical space that contains the service provider's
        trusted applications. Each security domain requires the management operations
        of trusted applications (TAs) in the form of installation, update
        and deletion.
      </t>
      
      <t>The protocol builds on the following properties of the system:
        <list style="numbers">
          <t>The SP needs to determine security-relevant information of a device
          before provisioning information to a TEE. Examples include 
          the verification of the root of trust, the type of firmware 
          installed, and the type of TEE included in a device. 
          </t>
          <t>A TEE in a device needs to determine whether a SP or the TSM is authorized 
            to manage applications in the TEE. 
          </t>
          <t>Secure Boot must be able to ensure a TEE is genuine.</t>
        </list>
      </t>

      <t>This specification defines message payloads 
        exchanged between devices and a TSM but does not mandate a specific transport.

            <t>A Trust Service Manager (TSM) is at the core to the protocol
              that manages device trust check on behalf of service providers
              for
              the ecosystem scalability. In addition to its device trust
              management for a service provider, the TSM provides Security
              Domain management and TA management in a device, in particularly,
              over-the-air update to keep Trusted Applications up to date and clean up
              when a version should be removed.

              of root certificates, called Trust Anchors,
              from trusted
              Certificate Authorities that a TSM will be
              validated against. A

      <t>In the previous diagram, different Certificate Authorities can be used
        respectively for different types of certificates. OTrP Messages are
        always
        signed, where the signer keys is the message creator's key pair
        such as a
        FW key pair, TEE key pair or TSM key pair.
      </t>

      <t>The main OTrP Protocol component is the set of standard JSON messages
        created by TSM to deliver device SD and TA management commands to a
        device, and device attestation and response messages created by TEE to
        respond to TSM OTrP Messages.
      </t>

      <t>The communication method of OTrP Messages between a TSM and TEE in a
      device is left to TSM providers for maximal interoperability. A TSM can
      work with its SP and Client Applications how it gets OTrP Messages from a
      TSM. When a Client Application has had an OTrP Message from its TSM, it
      is imperative to have an interoperable interface to communicate with
      various TEE types. This is the OTrP Agent interface that serves this
      purpose. The OTrP Agent doesn't need to know the actual content of OTrP
      Messages except for the TEE routing information.

      <section anchor="derivedkeys" title="Derived Keys in the Protocol">
        <t>
          The protocol generates the following two key pairs in run time to
          assist
          message communication and anonymous verification between TSM
          and TEE.
        </t>

        <t>
          1. TEE Anonymous Key (TEE AIK): one derived key pair per TEE in a
          device
        </t>
        <t>
          The purpose of the key pair is to sign data by a TEE without using
          its TEE device key for anonymous attestation to a Client Application.
          This key is generated in the first GetDeviceState query. The public
          key of the key pair is returned to the caller Client Application for
          future TEE returned data validation.
        </t>
        <t>
          2. TEE SP AIK: one derived key per SP in a device
        </t>
        <t>
          The purpose of this key pair is for a TSM to encrypt TA binary data
          when it sends a TA to a device for installation. This key is
          generated in the first SD creation for a SP. It is deleted when all
          SDs are removed for a SP in a device.
        </t>
        <t>
          With the presence of a TEE SP AIK, it isn't necessary to have a
          shared SP
          independent TEE AIK. For the initial release, this
          specification will
          not use TEE AIK.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="sdtree" title="Security Domain Hierarchy and Ownership">
        <t>
          The primary job of a TSM is to help a SP to manage its trusted
          applications.
          A TA is typically installed in a SD. A SD is commonly
          created for a SP.
        </t>
        <t>
          When a SP delegates its SD and TA management to a TSM, a SD is
          created on behalf of a TSM in a TEE and the owner of the SD is
          assigned to the TSM. A SD may be associated with a SP but the TSM has
          full privilege to manage the SD for the SP.
        </t>
        <t>
          Each SD for a SP is associated with only one TSM. When a SP changes
          TSM, a new SP SD must be created to associate with the new TSM. TEE
          will maintain a registry of TSM ID and SP SD ID mapping.
        </t>
        <t>
          From a SD ownership perspective SD tree is flat and there is only one
          level. A SD is associated with its owner. It is up to TEE's
          implementation how it maintains SD binding information for TSM and
          different SPs under the same TSM.
        </t>
        <t>
          It is an important decision in this protocol specification that a TEE
          doesn't need to know whether a TSM is authorized to manage SD for a
          SP. This authorization is implicitly triggered by a SP Client
          Application, which instructs what TSM it wants to use. A SD is always
          associated with a TSM in addition to its SP ID. A rogue TSM isn't
          able to do anything on an unauthorized SP's SD managed by another TSM.
        </t>
        <t>
          Since a TSM may support multiple SPs, sharing the same SD name for
          different SP creates a dependency in deleting a SD. A SD can be
          deleted only after all TAs associated with this SD is deleted. A SP
          cannot delete a Security Domain on its own with a TSM if a TSM
          decides to introduce such sharing. There are cases where multiple
          virtual SPs belong to the same organization, and a TSM chooses to use
          the same SD name for those SPs. This is totally up to the TSM
          implementation and out of scope of this specification.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="sdownerid"
        title="SD Owner Identification and TSM 
     Certificate Requirements">
        <t>
          There is a need of cryptographically binding proof about the owner of
          a SD in device. When a SD is created on behalf of a TSM, a future
          request from the TSM must present itself as a way that the TEE can
          verify it is the true owner. The certificate itself cannot reliably
          used as the owner because TSM may change its certificate.
        </t>
        <t>
          To this end, each TSM will be associated with a trusted identifier
          defined as an attribute in the TSM certificate. This field is kept
          the same when the TSM renew its certificates. A TSM CA is responsible
          to vet the requested TSM attribute value.
        </t>
        <t>
          This identifier value must not collide among different TSM providers,
          and one TSM shouldn't be able to claim the identifier used by another
          TSM provider.
        </t>
        <t>
          The certificate extension name to carry the identifier can initially
          use SubjectAltName:registeredID. A dedicated new extension name may
          be registered later.
        </t>
        <t>
          One common choice of the identifier value is the TSM's service URL. A
          CA can verify the domain ownership of the URL with the TSM in the
          certificate enrollment process.
        </t>
        <t>
          TEE can assign this certificate attribute value as the TSM owner ID
          for the SDs that are created for the TSM.
        </t>
        <t>
          An alternative way to represent a SD ownership by a TSM is to have a
          unique secret key upon SD creation such that only the creator TSM is
          able to produce a Proof-of-Possession (POP) data with the secret.

      <t>OTrP Agent is an Rich Application or SDK that facilitates
      communication between a TSM and TEE. It also provides interfaces for TSM
      SDK or Client Applications to query and trigger TA installation that the
      application needs to use.
      </t>
      <t>
        This interface for Client Applications may be commonly an Android
        service call. A Client Application interacts with a TSM, and turns
        around to pass messages received from TSM to OTrP Agent.
      </t>
      <t>In all cases, a Client Application needs to be able to identify an
      OTrP Agent that it can use.
      </t>
      <section anchor="agentrole" title="Role of OTrP Agent">
        <t>
          OTrP Agent is responsible to communicate with TEE. It takes request
          messages from an application. The input data is mostly from a TSM
          that an application communicates. An application may also directly 
          call OTrP Agent for some TA query functions.
        </t>
        <t>
          OTrP Agent may internally process a request from TSM. At least, it
          needs to know where to route a message, e.g. TEE instance. It doesn't
          need to process or verify message content.
        </t>
        <t>
          OTrP Agent returns TEE / TFW generated response messages to the
          caller. OTrP Agent isn't expected to handle any network connection
          with an application or TSM.
        </t>
        <t>
          OTrP Agent only needs to return an OTrP Agent error message if the TEE
          is not reachable for some reason. Other errors are represented as response messages returned from the TEE which will then be passed to the TSM.

            OTrP Agent installation is commonly carried out at OEM time. A

          </t>
          <t>
            It is important to ensure a legitimate OTrP Agent is installed and

            We anticipate only one shared OTrP Agent instance in a device. The

          </t>
          <t>
            With one shared OTrP Agent, the OTrP Agent provider is responsible
            to allow multiple TSMs and TEE providers to achieve
            interoperability. With a standard OTrP Agent interface, TSM can
            implement its own SDK for its SP Client Applications to work with
            this OTrP Agent.

        An OTrP Message is designed to provide end-to-end security. It is always
        signed
        by its creator. In addition, an OTrP Message is typically
        encrypted
        such that only the targeted device TEE or TSM provider is able
        to
        decrypt and view the actual content.

      <section anchor="format" title="Message Format">
        <t>OTrP Messages use JSON format for JSON's simple readability and

          The OTrP

        <t>OTrP signed messages only requires the signing algorithm as the

        <t>
          OTrP signed message will be given an explicit Request or Response
          property

          The top element "
          &lt;name&gt;[Signed][Request | Response]" cannot be
          fully trusted to match
          the content because it doesn't participate the
          signature
          generation. However, a recipient can always match it with
          the value
          associated with the property "payload". It purely serves to
          provide
          a quick reference for reading and method invocation.
        </t>
        <t>Furthermore, most properties in an unsigned OTrP messages are
          encrypted to provide end-to-end confidentiality. The only OTrP message
          that isn't encrypted is the initial device query message that asks
          for the device state information.
        </t>
        <t>Thus a typical OTrP Message consists of an encrypted and then signed
          JSON message. Some transaction data such as transaction ID and TEE
          information may need to be exposed to OTrP Agent for routing purpose.
          Such information is excluded from JSON encryption. The device's
          signer certificate itself is encrypted. The overall final message is
          a standard signed JSON message.
        </t>
        <t>As required by JSW/JWE, those JWE and JWS related elements will be
          BASE64URL encoded. Other binary data elements specific to the OTrP
          specification are BASE64 encoded. This specification will identify
          elements that should be BASE64 and those elements that are to be
          BASE64URL encoded.
        </t>

        <section
          title="Identifying signing and Encryption keys for JWS/JWE messaging">
          <t>
            JWS and JWE messaging allow various options for identifying the
            signing and
            encryption keys, for example, it allows optional
            elements including
            "x5c", "x5t" and "kid" in the header to cover
            various
            possibilities.
          </t>
          <t>
            In order to protect privacy, it is important that the device's
            certificate
            is released only to a trusted TSM, and that it is
            encrypted. The
            TSM will need to know the device certificate, but
            untrusted parties
            must not be able to get the device certificate.
            All OTrP messaging conversations between a TSM and device begin
            with
            GetDeviceStateRequest / GetDeviceStateResponse. These messages
            have
            elements built into them to exchange signing certificates,
            described in the "Detailed Message Specification" section. Any
            subsequent messages in the conversation that follow on from this
            are implicitly using the same certificates for signing/encryption,
            and as a result the certificates or references 
            may be ommitted in those subsequent messages.
          </t>
          <t>
            In other words, the signing key identifier in the use of JWS and
            JWE here
            may be absent in the subsequent messages after the initial
            GetDeviceState query.
          </t>
          <t>
            This has implication on the TEE and TSM implementation: they
            have to cache the signer certificates for the subsequent
            message signature validation in the session. It may be easier
            for a TSM service to cache transaction session information
            but not so for a TEE in a device. A TSM should check a
            device's capability to decide whether it should include its
            TSM signer certificate and OCSP data in each subsequent
            request message. The device's caching capability is reported
            reported in GetDeviceStateResponse signerreq parameter.

      <section title="JSON Signing and Encryption Algorithms">
        <t>
          The OTrP JSON signing algorithm shall use SHA256 or a stronger
          hash method with respective key type. JSON Web Algorithm RS256
          or ES256 <xref target="RFC7518"/> SHALL be used for RSA with SHA256 and
          ECDSA with SHA256. If RSA with SHA256 is used, the JSON web
          algorithm representation is as follows.
        </t>

        <t>
          <list hangIndent="4" style="empty">

        </t>

        <t>
          The (BASE64URL encoded) "protected" header property in a signed

        <t>
          If ECSDA with P-256 curve and SHA256 are used for signing, the JSON
          signing algorithm representation is as follows.

          <list hangIndent="4" style="empty">
            <t>{"alg":"ES256"}</t>

          The value for the "protected" field will be the following.

          recipient typically has an asymmetric key pair. Therefore CEK will be
          encrypted by the recipient's public key.

      <section title="OTrP Request Message Routing Rules">
        <t>
          For each command that a TSM wants to send to a device, the TSM
          generates a request message. This is typically triggered by a
          Client Application that uses the TSM. The Client Application
          initiates contact with the TSM and receives TSM OTrP Request
          messages according to the TSM's implementation. The Client
          Application forwards the OTrP message to an OTrP Agent in the
          device, which in turn sends the message to the active TEE in
          the device.
        </t>
        <t>The current version of specification assumes that each device has
          only one active TEE, and OTrP Agent is responsible to connect to the
          active TEE. This is the case today with devices in the market.
        </t>
        <t>Upon TEE responding with a request, the OTrP Agent gets OTrP
          response messages back to the Client Application that sends the
          request. In case the target TEE fails to respond the request, the
          OTrP Agent will be responsible to generate an error message to reply
          the Client Application. The Client Application forwards any data it
          received to its TSM.

          command is triggered when a SP's Client Application contacts
          its TSM to check whether the underlying device is ready for TA
          operations.
        </t>
        <t>
          This command queries a device's current TEE state. A device TEE
          will report its version, its FW version, and list of all SD and
          TA in the device that is managed by the requesting TSM. TSM may
          determine whether the device is trustworthy and decide to carry
          out additional commands according to the response from this
          query.
        </t>
        <t>
          The request message of this command is signed by TSM. The
          response message from TEE is encrypted. A random message
          encryption key (MK) is generated by TEE, and this encrypted key
          is encrypted by the receiving TSM public key such that only the TSM who
          sent the request is able to decrypt and view the response
          message.

      <t>
        It is important to know that the state of a device is appropriate
        before
        trusting that a device is what it says it is. The attestation
        scheme
        for
        OTrP must also be able to cope with different TEEs, those that
        are OTrP
        compliant and those that use another mechanism. In the initial
        version,
        only one active TEE is assumed.
      </t>
      <t>
        It is out of scope about how TSM and device implement the trust
        hierarchy
        verification. However, it is helpful to understand what each
        system
        provider should do in order to properly implement OTrP trust
        hierarchy.

            It is proposed that attestation for OTrP is based on the SBM
            secure boot layer, and that further attestation is not
            performed within the TEE itself during security domain
            operations. The rationale is that the device boot process
            will be defined to start with a secure boot approach that,
            using eFuse, only releases attestation signing capabilities
            into the SBM once a secure boot has been established. In this
            way the release of the attestation signer can be considered
            the first "platform configuration metric", using TCG
            terminology.

        started. The SBM must then be able to receive the identity certificate
        from the TEE (if that TEE is OTrP compliant). The identity certificate
        and keys will need to be baked into the TEE image, and therefore also
        covered by the code signer hash during the manufacture process. The

        <section title="Attestation hierarchy establishment: TSM">
          <t>Before a TSM can begin operation in the marketplace it must
            obtain a TSM key pair and certificate (TSMpub, TSMpriv) from a CA 
            that is registered in the trust store of the TEE. In this way, the
            TEE can check the intermediate and root CA and verify that it 
            trusts this TSM to perform operations on the TEE.

      <section title="TEE Attestation">
        <t>It is important that the TSM can trust that it is talking to a

        trusted. </t>

          TA will be delivered in an encrypted form. This encryption is an
          additional layer within the message encryption described in the 
          'Basic protocol profile' section of this document. The TA binary 
          is encrypted for each target device with the device's TEE SP AIK 
          public key. A TSM may do this encryption or provides the TEE SP AIK 
          public key to a SP such that the SP encrypts the encrypted TA to TSM 
          for distribution to TEE.

      <section title="TA trust check at TEE">
        <t>
        A TA binary is signed by a TA signer certificate. This TA signing
        certificate/private key belongs to the SP, and may be self-signed (i.e.
        it need not participate in a trust hierarchy). It is the responsibility
        of the TSM to only allow verified TAs from trusted SPs into the system.
        Delivery of that TA to the TEE is then the responsibility of the TEE,
        using the security mechanisms provided by the OTrP protocol. 
        </t>
      
        <t>
        We allow a way for application to check trustworthy of a TA. OTrP Agent
        will have a function to allow an application query the metadata of a TA.
        </t>
      
        <t>
          An application in the Rich O/S may perform verification of the TA by
          verifying the signature of the TA. The OTRPService.getTAInformation()
          function is available to return TEE supplied TA signer and TSM signer
          information to the application. An application can do additional
          trust check on the certificate returned for this TA. It may trust
          TSM, or require additional SP signer trust chaining.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="One TA Multiple SP Case">
        <t> A TA for different SP must have different identifier. A TA will be
        installed in different SD for the respective SP. </t>
      </section>

      <section title="OTrP Agent Trust Model">
        <t> An OTrP Agent could be malware in the vulnerable Android OS. A
        Client Application will connect its TSM provider for required TA
        installation. It gets command messages from TSM, and passes the message
        to the OTrP Agent. </t>
      
        <t> The OTrP protocol is a conduit for enabling the TSM to communicate
        with the device's TEE to manage SDs and TAs. All TSM messages are
        signed and sensitive data is encrypted such that the OTrP Agent cannot
        modify or capture sensitive data. </t>
      </section>

      <section title="OCSP Stapling Data for TSM signed messages">
        <t> The GetDeviceStateRequest message from TSM to TEE shall include
        OCSP stapling data for the TSM's signer certificate and that for
        intermediate CA certificates up to the root certificate so that the TEE
        side can verify the signer certificate's revocation status. </t>
      
        <t> Certificate revocation status check on a TA signer certificate is
        optional by a TEE. A TSM is generally expected to do proper TA
        application vetting and its SP signer trust validation. A TEE will
        trust a TA signer certificate's validation status done by a TSM when it
        trusts the TSM. </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Data protection at TSM and TEE">
        <t> The TEE implementation provides protection of data on the device. 
        It is the responsibility of the TSM to protect data on its servers. </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Privacy consideration">
        <t> Devices are issued with a unique TEE certificate to attest a device
        validity. This uniqueness also creates a privacy and tracking risk that
        must be mitigated. </t>
      
        <t> The TEE will only release the TEE certificate to a trusted TSM (it
        must verify the TSM certificate before proceeding). The OTrP protocol
        is designed such that only the TSM can obtain the TEE device
        certificate and firmware certificate - the GetDeviceState message
        requires signature checks to validate the TSM is trusted, and then
        delivers the device's certificate(s) encrypted such that only that TSM
        may decrypt the response. A Client Application will never see device
        certificate. </t>
      
        <t> A SP specific TEE SP AIK  (TEE SP Anonymous Key) is generated by
        the protocol for Client Applications. This provides a way for the
        Client Application to validate data sent from the TEE without requiring
        the TEE device certificate to be released to the client device rich O/S
        , and to optionally allow an SP to encrypt a TA for a target device
        without the SP needing to be supplied the TEE device certificate. </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Threat mitigation">
        <t> A rogue application may perform excessive TA loading. OTrP Agent
        implementation should protect against excessive calls. </t>
      
        <t> Rogue applications may request excessive SD creation request. The
        TSM is responsible to ensure this is properly guarded against. </t>
      
        <t> Rogue OTrP Agent could replay or send TSM messages out of
        sequence:e.g. TSM sends update1 and update2. OTrP Agent replays update2
        and update1 again, create unexpected result that client wants.
        "dsihash" is used to mitigate this. The TEE MUST make sure it stores
        DSI state and checks DSI state matches before it does another update.
        </t>
      
        <t> Concurrent calls from TSM to TEE should be handled properly by a
        TEE. It is up to the device to manage concurrency to the TEE. If
        multiple concurrent TSM operations take place these could fail due
        "dsihash" being modified by another concurrent operation. If locking is
        implemented on the client, this must be done in such a way that one
        application cannot lock other applications from using the TEE, except
        for a short term duration of the TSM operation taking place. For
        example, an OTrP operation that starts but never completes (e.g. loss
        of connectivity) must not prevent subsequent OTrP messages from being
        executed. </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Compromised CA">
        <t> If a root CA for TSM certificates is found compromised, some TEE
        trust anchor update mechanism should be devised. A compromised
        intermediate CA is covered by OCSP stapling and OCSP validation check
        in the protocol. A TEE should validate certificate revocation about a
        TSM certificate chain. </t>
      
        <t> If the root CA of some TEE device certificates is compromised,
        these devices might be rejected by TSM, which is a decision of TSM
        implementation and policy choice. Any intermediate CA for TEE device
        certificates should be validated by TSM with common CRL or OCSP method.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Compromised TSM">
        <t> The TEE should use validation of the supplied TSM certificates and
        OCSP stapled data to validate that the TSM is trustworthy. </t>
      
        <t> Since PKI is used, the integrity of the clock within the TEE
        determines the ability of the TEE to reject an expired TSM certificate,
        or revoked TSM certificate. Since OCSP stapling includes signature
        generation time, certificate validity dates are compared to the current
        time. </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Certificate renewal">
        <t> TFW and TEE device certificates are expected to be long lived, longer than the
        lifetime of a device. A TSM certificate usually has a moderate 
        lifetime of 2 to 5 years. TSM should get renewed or rekeyed certificates.The root CA
        certificates for TSM, which is embedded into the trust anchor store in
        a device, should have long lifetime that don't require device trust
        anchor update. On the other hand, it is imperative that OEM or device
        providers plan for support of trust anchor update in their shipped
        devices. </t>
