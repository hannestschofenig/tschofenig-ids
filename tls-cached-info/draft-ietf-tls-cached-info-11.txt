      Transport Layer Security (TLS) Cached Information Extension
                   draft-ietf-tls-cached-info-11.txt

Abstract

   Transport Layer Security (TLS) handshakes often include fairly static
   information, such as the server certificate and a list of trusted
   Certification Authorities (CAs).  This information can be of
   considerable size, particularly if the server certificate is bundled
   with a complete certificate path (including all intermediary
   certificates up to the trust anchor public key).

   This document defines an extension that omits the exchange of already
   available information.  The TLS client informs a server of cached
   information, for example from a previous TLS handshake, allowing the
   server to omit the already available information.

1.  Introduction

   Transport Layer Security (TLS) handshakes often include fairly static
   information, such as the server certificate and a list of trusted
   Certification Authorities (CAs).  This information can be of
   considerable size, particularly if the server certificate is bundled
   with a complete certificate path (including all intermediary
   certificates up to the trust anchor public key).

   Optimizing the exchange of information to a minimum helps to improve
   performance in environments where devices are connected to a network
   with characteristics like low bandwidth, high latency and high loss
   rate.  These types of networks exist, for example, when smart objects
   are connected using a low power IEEE 802.15.4 radio.  For more
   information about the challenges with smart object deployments please
   see [I-D.iab-smart-object-workshop].

   This specification defines a TLS extension that allows a client and a
   server to exclude transmission of cached information from the TLS
   handshake.

3.  Cached Information Extension

   This document defines a new extension type (cached_information(TBD)),
   which is used in client hello and server hello messages.  The
   extension type is specified as follows.



         enum {
              cached_information(TBD), (65535)
         } ExtensionType;

   The extension_data field of this extension, when included in the
   client hello, MUST contain the CachedInformation structure.



         enum {
              certificate_chain(1), trusted_cas(2), certificate(3) (255)
         } CachedInformationType;


         struct {
              CachedInformationType type;
              HashAlgorithm hash;
              opaque hash_value<1..255>;
         } CachedObject;

         struct {
              CachedObject cached_info<1..2^16-1>;
         } CachedInformation;

   When the CachedInformationType identifies a certificate_chain, then
   the hash_value field MUST include a hash calculated over the
   certificate_list element of a server side Certificate message,
   excluding the three length bytes of the certificate_list vector.

   When the CachedInformationType identifies a trusted_cas, then the
   hash_value MUST include a hash calculated over the
   certificate_authorities element of a server side CertificateRequest
   message, excluding the two length bytes of the
   certificate_authorities vector.

   The hash algorithm used to calculate hash values is conveyed in the
   'hash' field of the CachedObject element.  This document defines the
   following hash algorithms:

4.  Exchange Specification

   Clients supporting this extension MAY include the
   "cached_information" extension in the (extended) client hello, which
   MAY contain zero or more CachedObject attributes.

   Server supporting this extension MAY include the "cached_information"
   extension in the (extended) server hello, which MAY contain one or
   more CachedObject attributes.  By returning the "cached_information"
   extension the server indicates that it supports caching of each
   present CachedObject that matches the specified hash value.  The
   server MAY support other cached objects that are not present in the
   extension.

   Note: Clients may need the ability to cache different values
   depending on other information in the Client Hello that modify what
   values the server uses, in particular the Server Name Indication
   [I-D.ietf-tls-rfc4366-bis] value.

   Following a successful exchange of "cached_information" extensions,
   the server MAY substitute cached information in the handshake
   exchange with a matching CachedObject from the client hello
   "cached_information" extension.

   A substitution syntax that defines how the CachedObject structure is
   carried in the handshake message MUST be defined for each
   CachedInformationType in a way that does not violate the syntax of
   the handshake message.  The substitution syntax for
   certificate_chain(1) and trusted_cas(2) is provided below.

   The handshake protocol MUST proceed using the cached information as
   if it was provided in the handshake protocol.  The Finished message
   MUST be calculated over the actual data exchanged in the handshake
   protocol.  That is, the Finished message will be calculated over the
   hash values of cached information objects and not over the cached
   information that were omitted from transmission.

   The server MUST NOT include more than one CachedObject as
   substitution for the cached information.

4.1.  Substitution Syntax for certificate_chain

   When an object of type certificate_chain is provided in the client
   hello, the server MAY substitute the cached information with a
   matching hash value received from the client by expanding the
   Certificate handshake message as follows.

   Original handshake message syntax defined in RFC 5246 [RFC5246]:

Internet-Draft      TLS Cached Information Extension       December 2011


         opaque ASN.1Cert<1..2^24-1>;

         struct {
             ASN.1Cert certificate_list<0..2^24-1>;
         } Certificate;

   Substitution syntax is defined by expanding the syntax of the opaque
   ASN.1Cert structure:



   struct {
                 CachedObject ASN.1Cert<1..2^24-1>;
   } Certificate;

   Note: [I-D.wouters-tls-oob-pubkey] allows a PKIX certificate
   containing ONLY the SubjectPublicKeyInfo instead of the full
   information typically found in a certificate.  Hence, when this
   specification is used in combination with
   [I-D.wouters-tls-oob-pubkey] and the negotiated certificate type is
   RawPublicKey then the TLS server sends the hashed Certificate element
   that contains a ASN.1Cert with the mentioned raw public key.

4.2.  Substitution Syntax for trusted_cas

   When a hash for an object of type trusted_cas is provided in the
   client hello, the server MAY substitute the cached information with a
   matching hash value received from the client by expanding the
   CertificateRequest handshake message as follows.

   Original handshake message syntax defined in RFC 5246 [RFC5246]:



         opaque DistinguishedName<1..2^16-1>;

         struct {
             ClientCertificateType certificate_types<1..2^8-1>;
             SignatureAndHashAlgorithm
               supported_signature_algorithms<2^16-1>;
             DistinguishedName certificate_authorities<0..2^16-1>;
         } CertificateRequest

   The substitution syntax is defined by expanding the syntax of the
   opaque DistinguishedName structure:

5.  Security Considerations

   The hash algorithm used in this specification is required to have
   reasonable random properties in order to provide reasonably unique
   identifiers.  There is no requirement that this hash algorithm must
   have strong collision resistance.

   Caching information in an encrypted handshake (such as a renegotiated
   handshake) and sending a hash of that cached information in an
   unencrypted handshake might introduce integrity or data disclosure
   issues as it enables an attacker to identify if a known object (such
   as a known server certificate) has been used in previous encrypted
   handshakes.  Information object types defined in this specification,
   such as server certificates, are public objects and usually not
   sensitive in this regard, but implementers should be aware if any
   cached information are subject to such security concerns and in such
   case SHOULD NOT send a hash over encrypted data in en unencrypted
   handshake.

6.  IANA Considerations

6.1.  New Entry to the TLS ExtensionType Registry

   IANA is requested to add an entry to the existing TLS ExtensionType
   registry, defined in RFC 5246 [RFC5246], for cached_information(TBD)
   defined in this document.

6.2.  New Registry for CachedInformationType

   IANA is requested to establish a registry for TLS
   CachedInformationType values.  The first entries in the registry are

   o  certificate_chain(1)

   o  trusted_cas(2)

   The policy for adding new values to this registry, following the
   terminology defined in RFC 5226 [RFC5226], is as follows:

   o  0-63 (decimal): Standards Action

   o  64-223 (decimal): Specification Required

   o  224-255 (decimal): reserved for Private Use

6.3.  New Registry for HashAlgorithmType

   IANA is requested to establish a registry for HashAlgorithmType
   values and to populate the registry with an initial set of values
   listed in Section 3.

   The policy for adding new values to this registry, following the
   terminology defined in RFC 5226 [RFC5226], is as follows:

   o  0-63 (decimal): Standards Action

   o  64-223 (decimal): Specification Required

   o  224-255 (decimal): reserved for Private Use
