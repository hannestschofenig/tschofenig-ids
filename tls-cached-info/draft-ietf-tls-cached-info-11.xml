        <section title="Introduction">

   <t>Transport Layer Security (TLS) handshakes often include fairly 
   static information, such as the server certificate and a list of 
   trusted Certification Authorities (CAs). This information can be of 
   considerable size, particularly if the server certificate is bundled 
   with a complete certificate path (including all intermediary 
   certificates up to the trust anchor public key).</t>

   <t>Optimizing the exchange of information to a minimum helps to 
   improve performance in environments where devices are connected to a 
   network with characteristics like low bandwidth, high latency and high 
   loss rate. These types of networks exist, for example, when smart objects 
   are connected using a low power IEEE 802.15.4 radio. For more information 
   about the challenges with smart object deployments please see 
   <xref target="I-D.iab-smart-object-workshop"/>.</t>

   <t>This specification defines a TLS extension that allows a client and a 
   server to exclude transmission of cached information from the TLS handshake.

<t>
   This document defines a new extension type (cached_information(TBD)), which is used in
   client hello and server hello messages. The extension type
   is specified as follows.
</t>
        <t><figure>

<t>
The extension_data field of this extension, when included in the
client hello, MUST contain the CachedInformation structure.

]]></artwork>
          </figure></t>

		  <t>
   When the CachedInformationType identifies a certificate_chain, then
   the hash_value field MUST include a hash calculated over the certificate_list
   element of a server side Certificate message, excluding the three
   length bytes of the certificate_list vector.</t>

<t>When the CachedInformationType identifies a trusted_cas, then the hash_value
   MUST include a hash calculated over the certificate_authorities
   element of a server side CertificateRequest message, excluding the
   two length bytes of the certificate_authorities vector.
</t>
<t>
   The hash algorithm used to calculate hash values is conveyed in the 'hash' field of the 
   CachedObject element. This document defines the following hash algorithms:   
   <list style="symbols"> 
   <t>SHA-1: NIST FIPS PUB 180-3 <xref target="SHA"/></t>
   <t>SHA-224: RFC 3874 <xref target="RFC3874"/></t>

<!--   <t>MD5: RFC 1321 <xref target="RFC1321"/></t> --> 
</list> 

</t>
<t>
   This document establishes a registry for CachedInformationType types and additional 
   values can be added following the policy described in <xref target="IANA"/>.

<section title="Exchange Specification">

<t>Clients supporting this extension MAY include the "cached_information" extension in the
   (extended) client hello, which MAY contain zero or more CachedObject attributes. 
</t>
<t>
Server supporting this extension MAY include the "cached_information" extension 
in the (extended) server hello, which MAY contain one or more CachedObject attributes.
By returning the "cached_information" extension the server indicates that it
supports caching of each present CachedObject that matches the specified hash value. 
The server MAY support other cached objects that are not present in the extension.
</t>

<t>Note: Clients may need the ability to cache different values
   depending on other information in the Client Hello that modify what
   values the server uses, in particular the Server Name Indication
   <xref target="I-D.ietf-tls-rfc4366-bis"/> value.
</t>

<t>Following a successful exchange of "cached_information" extensions,
   the server MAY substitute cached information in the handshake
   exchange with a matching CachedObject from the client hello
   "cached_information" extension.
</t>
<t>A substitution syntax that defines how the CachedObject structure is
   carried in the handshake message MUST be defined for each
   CachedInformationType in a way that does not violate the syntax of
   the handshake message. The substitution syntax for
   certificate_chain(1) and trusted_cas(2) is provided below.</t>

<t>The handshake protocol MUST proceed using the cached information as
   if it was provided in the handshake protocol. The Finished message
   MUST be calculated over the actual data exchanged in the handshake
   protocol. That is, the Finished message will be calculated over the
   hash values of cached information objects and not over the cached
   information that were omitted from transmission.</t>

<t>The server MUST NOT include more than one CachedObject as
   substitution for the cached information.</t>


<section title="Substitution Syntax for certificate_chain">

<t>When an object of type certificate_chain is provided in the client
   hello, the server MAY substitute the cached information with a
   matching hash value received from the client by expanding the
   Certificate handshake message as follows.</t>

<t>Original handshake message syntax defined in RFC 5246 <xref target="RFC5246"/>:</t>

        <t><figure>

      opaque ASN.1Cert<1..2^24-1>;

      } Certificate;

   ASN.1Cert structure:</t>

              CachedObject ASN.1Cert<1..2^24-1>;
} Certificate;
]]></artwork>
          </figure></t>

 <t>Note:  <xref target="I-D.wouters-tls-oob-pubkey"/> allows a PKIX
 certificate containing ONLY the SubjectPublicKeyInfo instead of the full information typically found in a certificate. 
 Hence, when this specification is used in combination with <xref target="I-D.wouters-tls-oob-pubkey"/> 
 and the negotiated certificate type is RawPublicKey then the TLS server sends the hashed 
Certificate element that contains a ASN.1Cert with the mentioned raw public key.</t>

<section title="Substitution Syntax for trusted_cas">

<t>When a hash for an object of type trusted_cas is provided in the

        <section title="Security Considerations">
            <t>The hash algorithm used in this specification is required to have
   reasonable random properties in order to provide reasonably unique
   identifiers. There is no requirement that this
   hash algorithm must have strong collision resistance. <!-- However, since
   the hash algorithm is used to represent data in the finished
   calculation, the security properties of the finished calculation will
   change if a weaker hash algorithm is used to represent cached
   information compared with the hash algorithm used to calculate the
   finished message.--> </t>

<t>Caching information in an encrypted handshake (such as a renegotiated
   handshake) and sending a hash of that cached information in an
   unencrypted handshake might introduce integrity or data disclosure
   issues as it enables an attacker to identify if a known object (such
   as a known server certificate) has been used in previous encrypted
   handshakes. Information object types defined in this specification,
   such as server certificates, are public objects and usually not
   sensitive in this regard, but implementers should be aware if any
   cached information are subject to such security concerns and in such
   case SHOULD NOT send a hash over encrypted data in en unencrypted
   handshake.</t>
