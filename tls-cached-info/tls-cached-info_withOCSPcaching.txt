      Transport Layer Security (TLS) Cached Information Extension
                   draft-ietf-tls-cached-info-15.txt

Abstract

   Transport Layer Security (TLS) handshakes often include fairly static
   information, such as the server certificate and a list of trusted
   Certification Authorities (CAs).  This information can be of
   considerable size, particularly if the server certificate is bundled
   with a complete certificate path (including all intermediary
   certificates up to the trust anchor public key).

   This document defines an extension that omits the exchange of already
   available information.  The TLS client informs a server of cached
   information, for example from a previous TLS handshake, allowing the
   server to omit the already available information.

1.  Introduction

   Transport Layer Security (TLS) handshakes often include fairly static
   information, such as the server certificate and a list of trusted
   Certification Authorities (CAs).  This information can be of
   considerable size, particularly if the server certificate is bundled
   with a complete certificate path (including all intermediary
   certificates up to the trust anchor public key).

   Optimizing the exchange of information to a minimum helps to improve
   performance in environments where devices are connected to a network
   with characteristics like low bandwidth, high latency and high loss
   rate.  These types of networks exist, for example, when smart objects
   are connected using a low power IEEE 802.15.4 radio.  For more
   information about the challenges with smart object deployments please
   see [RFC6574].

Internet-Draft      TLS Cached Information Extension        October 2013


   This specification defines a TLS extension that allows a client and a
   server to exclude transmission of cached information from the TLS
   handshake.

   A typical example exchange may therefore look as follows.  First, the
   client and the server executes the usual TLS handshake.  The client
   may, for example, decide to cache the certificate provided by the
   server.  When the TLS client connects to the TLS server some time in
   the future, without using session resumption, it then attaches the
   cached_information extension defined in this document to the client
   hello message to indicate that it had cached the certificate, and it
   provides the fingerprint of it.  If the server's certificate had not
   changed then the TLS server does not need to send the full
   certificate to the client again.  In case the information had
   changed, the certificate payload is transmitted to the client to
   allow the client to update it's state information.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "MUST", "MUST NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Cached Information Extension

   This document defines a new extension type, cached_information (TBD),
   which is used in client hello and server hello messages.  The
   extension type is specified as follows.


         enum {
              cached_information(TBD), (65535)
         } ExtensionType;


   The extension_data field of this extension, when included in the
   client hello, MUST contain the CachedInformation structure.  This
   document defines four Cached Information Types, as shown in the enum
   of the CachedInformationType structure.


         enum {
              certificate_chain(1), trusted_cas(2),
              cert_status (3), multiple_cert_status (4),
              (255)
         } CachedInformationType;

         struct {

              CachedInformationType type;
              HashAlgorithm hash;
              opaque hash_value<1..255>;
         } CachedObject;

         struct {
              CachedObject cached_info<0..2^16-1>;
         } CachedInformation;


   The calculation of the fingerprints depends on the Cached Information
   Type:

   Cached Information Type 'certificate_chain':

      When the CachedInformationType identifies a certificate_chain,
      then the hash_value field MUST include the hash calculated over
      the certificate_list element of the Certificate message provided
      by the TLS server in an earlier exchange, excluding the three
      length bytes of the certificate_list vector.


   Cached Information Type 'trusted_cas':

      When the CachedInformationType identifies a trusted_cas, then the
      hash_value MUST include a hash calculated over the
      certificate_authorities element of the CertificateRequest message
      provided by the TLS server in an earlier exchange, excluding the
      two length bytes of the certificate_authorities vector.


   Cached Information Type 'cert_status':

      When the CachedInformationType identifies a cert_status, then the
      hash_value MUST include a hash calculated over the
      CertificateStatus message provided by the TLS server in an earlier
      exchange.


   Cached Information Type 'multiple_cert_status':

      When the CachedInformationType identifies a cert_status, then the
      hash_value MUST include a hash calculated over the
      CertificateStatus message provided by the TLS server in an earlier
      exchange.

   The hash algorithm used to calculate hash values is conveyed in the
   'hash' field of the CachedObject element.  The list of registered

   hash algorithms can be found in the TLS HashAlgorithm Registry, which
   was created by RFC 5246 [RFC5246].  The value zero (0) for 'none' is
   not an allowed choice for a hash algorithm and MUST NOT be used.

   This document establishes a registry for Cached Information Types and
   additional values can be added following the policy described in
   Section 7.

4.  Exchange Specification

   Clients supporting this extension MAY include the
   "cached_information" extension in the (extended) client hello, which
   MAY contain zero or more CachedObject attributes.  When a client
   sents a "cached_information" extension with zero CachedObject
   attributes then this tells the server that the client supports the
   extension but so far no objects have been cached.  This allows the
   client to subsequently learn, via the server's response, what
   extension the server is able to support.

   A server supporting this extension MAY include the
   "cached_information" extension in the (extended) server hello, which
   MAY contain one or more CachedObject elements it supports.  By
   returning the "cached_information" extension the server indicates
   that it supports caching of each present Cached Object Type.  The
   server MAY support other cached objects that are not present in the
   extension.  When the server indicates support for a specific Cached
   Information Type that has previously been indicated by the client
   then it MUST transmit the cached version of the data.  For Cached
   Information Types not listed in the client hello the server MUST NOT
   transmit the cached representation since it may lead to a failed
   protocol run.

   Note: If clients make use of the Server Name Indication [RFC6066]
   then clients may need to cache multiple data items for a single
   server since servers may host multiple 'virtual' servers at a single
   underlying network address.

   Following a successful exchange of the "cached_information"
   extensions in the client and server hello, the server omits sending
   the corresponding handshake message.  How information is omitted from
   the handshake message is defined per cached info type.  Section 4.1
   and Section 4.2 defines the syntax of the fingerprinted information.

   The handshake protocol MUST proceed using the information as if it
   was provided in the handshake protocol.  The Finished message MUST be
   calculated over the actual data exchanged in the handshake protocol.
   That is, the Finished message will be calculated over the information
   that was omitted from transmission by means of its present hash in

   the client hello and not through its presence in the handshake
   exchange.

   The server MUST NOT include more than one fingerprint for a single
   information element, i.e., at maximum only one CachedObject structure
   per replaced information is provided.

4.1.  Omitting the Certificate Chain

   When an object of type 'certificate_chain' is provided in the client
   hello, the server MAY replace the sequence of certificates with an
   empty sequence with an actual length field of zero (=empty vector).

   The original handshake message syntax is defined in RFC 5246
   [RFC5246] and has the following structure:


         opaque ASN.1Cert<1..2^24-1>;

         struct {
             ASN.1Cert certificate_list<0..2^24-1>;
         } Certificate;


   Note that [I-D.ietf-tls-oob-pubkey] allows the certificate payload to
   contain only the SubjectPublicKeyInfo instead of the full information
   typically found in a certificate.  Hence, when this specification is
   used in combination with [I-D.ietf-tls-oob-pubkey] and the negotiated
   certificate type is a raw public key then the TLS server omits
   sending a Certificate payload that contains an ASN.1Cert structure of
   the SubjectPublicKeyInfo.

4.2.  Omitting Information about Trusted CAs

   When a fingerprint for an object of type 'trusted_cas' is provided in
   the client hello, the server MAY send a DistinguishedName in the
   Certificate Request message with an actual length field of zero
   (=empty vector).

   The original handshake message syntax is defined in RFC 5246
   [RFC5246] and has the following structure:


         opaque DistinguishedName<1..2^16-1>;

         struct {
             ClientCertificateType certificate_types<1..2^8-1>;

               supported_signature_algorithms<2^16-1>;
             DistinguishedName certificate_authorities<0..2^16-1>;
         } CertificateRequest;


4.3.  Omitting the Certificate Status Information (OCSP Stapling)

   When a fingerprint for an object of type 'cert_status' is provided in
   the client hello, the server MAY omit sending the CertificateStatus
   message containing the OCSPResponse.

   The original CertificateStatus message syntax is defined in RFC 6066
   [RFC6066] and has the following structure:


         struct {
             CertificateStatusType status_type;
             select (status_type) {
                 case ocsp: OCSPResponse;
             } response;
         } CertificateStatus;

         opaque CertificateStatus<1..2^24-1>;


4.4.  Omitting the Status of Multiple Certificates (Multi-Stapling)

   When a fingerprint for an object of type 'multiple_cert_status' is
   provided in the client hello, the server MAY omit sending the
   CertificateStatus message containing the OCSPResponseList.

   The CertificateStatus message syntax, defined in
   [I-D.ietf-tls-multiple-cert-status-extension], has the following
   structure:


        struct {
          CertificateStatusType status_type;
          select (status_type) {
            case ocsp: OCSPResponse;
            case ocsp_multi: OCSPResponseList;
          } response;
        } CertificateStatus;

        opaque OCSPResponse<0..2^24-1>;

        struct {
          OCSPResponse ocsp_response_list<1..2^24-1>;

        } OCSPResponseList;


5.  Example

   The exchange in Figure 1 illustrates a client that contacts a server
   for the first time.  The client indicates the support for the cached
   info extension but it does not yet have any objects cached [1].  With
   [2] the TLS server indicates that it also supports the extension
   defined in this specification and informs the client that it also
   supports three Cached Information Types, namely 'certificate_chain',
   the 'trusted_cas', and 'foo-bar'.  The first two are defined in this
   document and 'foo-bar' is an imaginary extension that yet needs to be
   defined.  At this point in time the server does not omit anything
   since the client's cache is empty.  When the client receives the
   certificate message it puts it in the cache.


   client_hello
   cached_information=() // [1]
                          ->
                          <-  server_hello,
                              cached_information= //[2]
                              (certificate_chain, trusted_cas, foo-bar)
                              certificate,
                              server_key_exchange,
                              server_hello_done

   client_key_exchange,
   change_cipher_spec,
   finished                  ->

                          <- change_cipher_spec,
                             finished

   Application Data        <------->     Application Data

                Figure 1: Example: Client has empty cache.

   After some time the TLS client again interacts with the same TLS
   server and makes use of the TLS cached info extension, as shown in
   Figure 2.  The TLS client again indicates support for this
   specification via the cached_information extension, see [3], and
   indicates that it has stored the certificate_chain from the earlier
   exchange.  In [4] the server indicates that it has also indicates
   that supports the extension and that it will omit sending the full
   certificate chain (since the fingerprint provided by the client
   matches the value that the server has computed, i.e., the information

   has not yet changed).  Note that the TLS server also indicates the
   support for other Cached Information Types but since the client has
   not indicated support for them they are only included for information
   to the client.  In this example, the server only omits sending the
   full certificate chain.  With [5] the TLS server omits sending the
   certificate chain, as described in Section 4.1.



   (B) TLS Cached Extension Usage

   client_hello,
   cached_information=(certificate_chain)   -> // [3]

                          <-  server_hello,
                              cached_information= // [4]
                              (certificate_chain, trusted_cas, foo-bar)
                              certificate, // [5]
                              server_key_exchange,
                              server_hello_done

   client_key_exchange,
   change_cipher_spec,
   finished                  ->

                          <- change_cipher_spec,

6.  Security Considerations

   This specification defines a mechanism to reference stored state
   using a fingerprint.  Sending a fingerprint of cached information in
   an unencrypted handshake, as the client and server hello is, may
   allow an attacker or observer to correlate independent TLS exchanges.
   While some information elements used in this specification, such as
   server certificates, are public objects and usually not sensitive in
   this regard, others may be.  Those who implement and deploy this
   specification should therefore make an informed decision whether the
   cached information aligns with the defined security and privacy
   goals.  In case of concerns, it is advised to avoid sending the
   fingerprint of the data objects in clear.

   The hash algorithm used in this specification is required to have
   reasonable random properties in order to provide reasonably unique



Santesson & Tschofenig   Expires April 20, 2014                 [Page 9]

Internet-Draft      TLS Cached Information Extension        October 2013


   identifiers.  There is no requirement that this hash algorithm must
   have strong collision resistance.

   This extension is a performance optimization for the TLS handshake:
   it allows to omit sending certain payloads.  Since the fingerprints
   of these payloads are still exchanged in the client and server hello
   messages at least the fingerprints are included in the keyed message
   digest computation of the Finished message.

   In case of omitting OCSP responses it is important to point out that
   any time a new OCSP has to be generated the cache becomes invalid and
   certain features of OCSP, such as the usage of the nonce, limits the
   ability to cache values.  There is a tradeoff between frequently
   sending fresh OCSP responses and optimizing the performance with the
   help of caching and the inband delivery of these OCSP responses in
   the TLS handshake.

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  TLS ExtensionType Registry

   IANA is requested to add an entry to the existing TLS ExtensionType
   registry, defined in RFC 5246 [RFC5246], for the cached_information
   (TBD) extension defined in this document.

7.2.  Cached Information Type Registry

   IANA is requested to establish a new registry and to populate it with
   the following initial values:


   Symbolic Name              | Value | Specification
   ---------------------------+-------+----------------
   certificate_chain          |  1    | [This RFC]
   trusted_cas                |  2    | [This RFC]
   cert_status                |  3    | [This RFC]
   multiple_cert_status       |  4    | [This RFC]


   The policy for adding new values to this registry, following the
   terminology defined in RFC 5226 [RFC5226], is as follows:

   o  0-63 (decimal): Standards Action

   o  64-223 (decimal): Specification Required

   o  224-255 (decimal): Reserved for Private Use
