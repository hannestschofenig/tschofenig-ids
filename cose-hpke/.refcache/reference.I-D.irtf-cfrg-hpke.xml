      <abstract>
	 <t>   This document describes a scheme for hybrid public-key encryption
   (HPKE).  This scheme provides a variant of public-key encryption of
   arbitrary-sized plaintexts for a recipient public key.  It also
   includes three authenticated variants, including one which
   authenticates possession of a pre-shared key, and two optional ones
   which authenticate possession of a KEM private key.  HPKE works for
   any combination of an asymmetric key encapsulation mechanism (KEM),
   key derivation function (KDF), and authenticated encryption with
   additional data (AEAD) encryption function.  Some authenticated
   variants may not be supported by all KEMs.  We provide instantiations
   of the scheme using widely used and efficient primitives, such as
   Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman key agreement, HKDF, and SHA2.

   This document is a product of the Crypto Forum Research Group (CFRG)
   in the IRTF.
