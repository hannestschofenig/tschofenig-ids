Abstract

   This document specifies Claims for use within X.509 certificates.
   These X.509 certificates are produced by an Attester as part of the
   remote attestation procedures and consitute Evidence.

   This document follows the Remote ATtestation procedureS (RATS)
   architecture where Evidence is sent by an Attester and processed by a
   Verifier.

1.  Introduction

   Trusted execution environments, like secure elements and hardware
   security modules, are now widely used, which provide a safe
   environment to place security sensitive code, such as cryptography,
   secure boot, secure storage, and other essential security functions.
   These security functions are typically exposed through a narrow and
   well-defined interface, and can be used by operating system libraries
   and applications.

Internet-Draft      X.509-based Attestation Evidence        October 2023


   When a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) library is requesting a
   certificate from a Certification Authority (CA), a PKI end entity may
   wish to provide Evidence of the security properties of the trusted
   execution environment in which the private key is stored.  This
   Evidence is to be verified by a Relying Party, such as the
   Registration Authority or the Certification Authority as part of
   validating an incoming CSR against a given certificate policy.
   [I-D.ietf-lamps-csr-attestation] defines how to carry Evidence in
   either PKCS#10 [RFC2986] or Certificate Request Message Format (CRMF)
   [RFC4211].

   [I-D.ietf-lamps-csr-attestation] is agnostic to the content and the
   encoding of Evidence.  To offer interoperability it is necessary to
   define a format that is utilized in a specific deployment environment
   environment.  Hardware security modules and other trusted execution
   environments, which have been using ASN.1-based encodings for a long
   time prefer the use of the same format throughout their software
   ecosystem.  For those use cases this specification has been
   developed.

   This specification re-uses the claims defined in [I-D.ietf-rats-eat],
   and encodes them as an extension in an X.509 certificate [RFC5280].
   While the encoding of the claims is different to what is defined in
   [I-D.ietf-rats-eat], the semantics of the claims is retained.  This
   specification is not an EAP profile, as defined in Section 6 of
   [I-D.ietf-rats-eat]

   This specification was designed to meet the requirements published by
   the CA Browser Forum to convey properties about hardware security
   models, such as non-exportability, which must be enabled for storing
   publicly-trusted code-signing keys.  Hence, this specification is
   supposed to be used with the attestation extension for Certificate
   Signing Requests (CSRs), see [I-D.ietf-lamps-csr-attestation], but
   Evidence encoded as X.509 certificates may also be used in other
   context.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document re-uses the terms defined in [RFC9334] related to
   remote attestation.  Readers of this document are assumed to be
   familiar with the following terms: Evidence, Claim, Attestation
   Result, Attester, Verifier, and Relying Party.

Internet-Draft      X.509-based Attestation Evidence        October 2023


3.  Claims

3.1.  Nonce

   The "nonce" claim is used to provide freshness.

   The Nonce claim is used to carry the challenge provided by the caller
   to demonstrate freshness of the generated token.  The following
   constraints apply to the nonce-type:

   *  The length MUST be either 32, 48, or 64 bytes.

   *  Only a single nonce value is conveyed.

   The nonce claim is defined as follows:

      id-ce-evidence-nonce OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=
            { id-ce TBD_evidence TBD_nonce }

      claim_nonce ::= OCTET STRING

   See Section 4.1 of [I-D.ietf-rats-eat] for a description of this
   claim.

3.2.  Claims Describing the Entity

   The claims in this section describe the entity itself.

3.2.1.  ueid (Universal Entity ID) Claim

   The "ueid" claim conveys a UEID, which identifies an individual
   manufactured entity.  This identifier is a globally unique and
   permanent identifier.  See Section 4.2.1 of [I-D.ietf-rats-eat] for a
   description of this claim.  Three types of UEIDs are defined, which
   are distinguished via a type field.

   The ueid claim is defined as follows:

      id-ce-evidence-ueid OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=
            { id-ce TBD_evidence TBD_ueid }

      claim_ueid ::= SEQUENCE {
          type    INTEGER ( RAND(1), EUI(2), IMEI(3),...),
          value   OCTET STRING
      }

Internet-Draft      X.509-based Attestation Evidence        October 2023


3.3.  sueids (Semi-permanent UEIDs) Claim (SUEIDs)

   The "sueids" claim conveys one or more semi-permanent UEIDs (SUEIDs).
   An SUEID has the same format, characteristics and requirements as a
   UEID, but MAY change to a different value on entity life-cycle events
   while the ueid claim is permanent.  An entity MAY have both a UEID
   and SUEIDs, neither, one or the other.

   There MAY be multiple SUEIDs and each has a text string label the
   purpose of which is to distinguish it from others.

   See Section 4.2.2 of [I-D.ietf-rats-eat] for a description of this
   claim.

   The sueids claim is defined as follows:

      id-ce-evidence-sueids OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=
            { id-ce TBD_evidence TBD_sueids }

      claim_sueids ::= SEQUENCE {
          label   OCTET STRING,
          type    INTEGER ( RAND(1), EUI(2), IMEI(3),...),
          value   OCTET STRING
      }

3.4.  oemid (Hardware OEM Identification) Claim

   The "oemid" claim identifies the Original Equipment Manufacturer
   (OEM) of the hardware.

   See Section 4.2.3 of [I-D.ietf-rats-eat] for a description of this
   claim.

   The value of this claim depends on the type of OEMID and three types
   of IDs are defined:

   *  OEMIDs using a 128-bit random number.  Section 4.2.3.1 of
      [I-D.ietf-rats-eat] defines this type.

   *  an IEEE based OEMID using a global registry for MAC addresses and
      company IDs.  Section 4.2.3.1 of [I-D.ietf-rats-eat] defines this
      type.

   *  OEMIDs using Private Enterprise Numbers maintained by IANA.
      Section 4.2.3.3 of [I-D.ietf-rats-eat] defines this type.

   The oemid claim is defined as follows:

Internet-Draft      X.509-based Attestation Evidence        October 2023


      id-ce-evidence-oemid OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=
            { id-ce TBD_evidence TBD_oemid }

      claim_oemid ::= SEQUENCE {
          type    INTEGER ( PEN(1), IEEE(2), RANDOM(3),...),
          value   OCTET STRING
      }

   [Editor's Note: The value for the PEN is numeric.  For the other two
   types it is a binary string.]

3.5.  hwmodel (Hardware Model) Claim

   The "hwmodel" claim differentiates hardware models, products and
   variants manufactured by a particular OEM, the one identified by OEM
   ID.  It MUST be unique within a given OEM ID.  The concatenation of
   the OEM ID and "hwmodel" give a global identifier of a particular
   product.  The "hwmodel" claim MUST only be present if an "oemid"
   claim is present.

   See Section 4.2.4 of [I-D.ietf-rats-eat] for a description of this
   claim.

   The hwmodel claim is defined as follows:

      id-ce-evidence-hwmodel OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=
            { id-ce TBD_evidence TBD_hwmodel }

      claim_hwmodel ::= OCTET STRING

3.6.  hwversion (Hardware Version) Claim

   The "hwversion" claim is a text string the format of which is set by
   each manufacturer.  A "hwversion" claim MUST only be present if a
   "hwmodel" claim is present.

   See Section 4.2.5 of [I-D.ietf-rats-eat] for a description of this
   claim.

   The hwversion claim is defined as follows:

      id-ce-evidence-hwversion OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=
            { id-ce TBD_evidence TBD_hwwversion }

      hwversion ::= OCTET STRING

Internet-Draft      X.509-based Attestation Evidence        October 2023


3.7.  swversion (Software Version) Claim

   The "swversion" claim makes use of the CoSWID version-scheme defined
   in Section 4.1 of [RFC9393] to give a simple version for the
   software.  A "swversion" claim MUST only be present if a "swname"
   claim is present.

   See Section 4.2.5 of [I-D.ietf-rats-eat] for a description of this
   claim.

   The swversion claim is defined as follows:

      id-ce-evidence-swversion OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=
            { id-ce TBD_evidence TBD_swversion }

      swversion ::= PrintableString

3.8.  dbgstat (Debug Status) Claim

   The "dbgstat" claim applies to entity-wide or submodule-wide debug
   facilities and diagnostic hardware built into chips.  It applies to
   any software debug facilities related to privileged software that
   allows system-wide memory inspection, tracing or modification of non-
   system software like user mode applications.

   See Section 4.2.9 of [I-D.ietf-rats-eat] for a description of this
   claim and the semantic of the values in the enumerated list.

   The dbgstat claim is defined as follows:

      id-ce-evidence-dbgstat OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=
            { id-ce TBD_evidence TBD_dbgstat }

      dbgstat ::= ENUMERATED {
         dsEnabled                   (0),
         disabled                    (1),
         disabledSinceBoot           (2),
         disabledPermanently         (3),
         disabledFullyAndPermanently (4)
      }

3.9.  software-component Claim

   The Software Components claim is a list of software components that
   includes all the software (both code and configuration) loaded by the
   root of trust.

Internet-Draft      X.509-based Attestation Evidence        October 2023


   Each entry in the Software Components list describes one software
   component using the attributes described below:

   *  The Measurement Type attribute is short string representing the
      role of this software component.  Examples include the bootloader
      code, the bootloader configuration, and firmware running in the
      Trusted Execution Environment.

   *  The Measurement Value attribute represents a hash of the invariant
      software component in memory at startup time.  The value MUST be a
      cryptographic hash of 256 bits or stronger.  For interoperability,
      SHA-256 is assumed to be the default.

   *  The Signer ID attribute is the hash of a signing authority public
      key for the software component.  This can be used by a Verifier to
      ensure the components were signed by an expected trusted source.

   *  The Measurement Description contains the OID identifying the hash
      algorithm used to compute the corresponding Measurement Value.
      For interoperability, SHA-256 is the default.  If the default
      algorithm is used, then this field can be omitted.  The values for
      identifying the hash algorithms MUST be taken from [IANA-Hash].

   The description of the software-component claims is taken from
   Section 4.4.1 of [I-D.tschofenig-rats-psa-token]

   The software-component claim is defined as follows:

      id-ce-evidence-softwarecomponent OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=
            { id-ce TBD_evidence TBD_softwarecomponent }

      softwarecomponent ::= SEQUENCE {
          measurement-type    PrintableString,
          measurement-value   OCTET STRING,
          signer-id           OCTET STRING,
          measurement-desc    OBJECT IDENTIFIER
      }

      softwarecomponents  ::=  SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX)
                               OF softwarecomponent

3.11.  cc_conf (Common Criteria Conformance) Claim

   TBD: Tomas/Mike to add text here.

4.  Security Considerations

   This specification re-uses the claims from the EAT specification but
   relies on the security protection offered by X.509 certificate and
   particularly the digital signature covering the certificate.  This
   digital signature is computed with the Attestation Key available on
   the device, see Section 12.1 of [RFC9334] for considerations
   regarding the generation, the use and the protection of these
   Attestation Keys.  Although the encoding of an X.509 certificate has
   been selected for conveying Claims from an Attester to a Relying
   Party, this document uses a model that is very different from Web PKI
   deployment where CAs verify whether an applicant for a certificate
   legitimately represents the domain name(s) in the certificate.  Since
   the Attester located at the end entity creates the X.509 certificate
   with claims defined in this document, it conceptually acts like a CA.
   This document inherits the remote attestation architecture described
   in [RFC9334].  With the re-use of the claims from [I-D.ietf-rats-eat]
   the security and privacy considerations apply also to this document
   even though the encoding in this specification is different from the
   encoding of claims discussed by [I-D.ietf-rats-eat].

   Evidence contains information that may be unique to a device and may
   therefore allow to single out an individual device for tracking
   purposes.  Deployments that have privacy requirements must take
   appropriate measures to ensure that claim values can only identify a
   group of devices and that the Attestation Keys are used across a
   number of devices as well.

   To verify the Evidence, the primary need is to check the signature
   and the correct encoding of the claims.  To produce the Attestation
   Result, the Verifier will use Endorsements, Reference Values, and
   Appraisal Policies.  The policies may require that certain claims
   must be present and that their values match registered reference
   values.  All claims may be worthy of additional appraisal.

5.  IANA Considerations

   TBD: OIDs for all the claims listed in this document.
