      A Minimal (Datagram) Transport Layer Security Implementation
                draft-tschofenig-lwig-tls-minimal-00.txt

Abstract

   Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a widely used security protocol
   that offers communication security services at the transport layer.
   The initial design of TLS was focused on the protection of
   applications running on top of the Transmission Control Protocol
   (TCP), and was a good match for securing the Hypertext Transfer
   Protocol (HTTP).  Subsequent standardization efforts lead to the
   publication of Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS), which added
   the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), and the Datagram Congestion Control
   Protocol (DCCP).  The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP), as
   a more recent connection-oriented transport protocol, also benefits
   from TLS support.

   TLS can be customized in a variety of ways and every feature has a
   certain cost.  To offer input for implementers and system architects
   this document illustrates the implications of selected TLS features
   for the code size.

Internet-Draft                 Minimal TLS                  October 2012


1.  Introduction

   The IETF published three versions of Transport Layer Security: TLS
   Version 1.0 [RFC2246], TLS Version 1.1 [RFC4346], and TLS Version 1.2
   [RFC5246].  Section 1.1 of [RFC4346] explains the differences between
   Version 1.0 and Version 1.1; those are small security improvements,
   including the usage of an explicit initialization vector to protect
   against cipher-block-chaining attacks, which all have little impact
   for the size of the code.  Section 1.2 of [RFC5246] describes the
   differences between Version 1.1 and Version 1.2.  TLS 1.2 introduces
   a couple of major changes with impact to size of an implementation.
   In particular, prior TLS versions hardcoded the MD5/SHA-1 combination
   in the pseudorandom function (PRF).  As a consequence, any TLS
   Version 1.0 and Version 1.1 implementation had to have MD5 and SHA1
   code even if the remaining cryptographic primitives used other
   algorithms.  With TLS Version 1.2 the two had been replaced with
   cipher-suite-specified PRFs.  In addition, the TLS extensions
   definition [RFC6066] and various AES ciphersuites [RFC3268] got
   merged into the TLS Version 1.2 specification.

   All three TLS specifications list a mandatory-to-implement
   ciphersuite: for TLS Version 1.0 this was
   TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA, for TLS Version 1.1 it was
   TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA, and for TLS Version 1.2 it is
   TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA.  There is, however, an important
   qualification to these compliance statements, namely that they are
   only valid in the absence of an application profile standard
   specifying otherwise.

   All TLS versions offer a separation between authentication and key
   exchange and bulk data protection.  The former is more costly
   performance- and message-wise.  The details of the authentication and
   key exchange, using the TLS Handshake, vary with the chosen
   ciphersuite.  With new ciphersuites the TLS feature-set can easily be
   enhanced, in case the already large collection of ciphersuites, see
   [TLS-IANA], does not match the requirements.

   Once the TLS Handshake has been successfully completed the necessary
   keying material and parameters are setup for usage with the TLS
   Record Layer, which is responsible for bulk data protection.  The TLS
   Record Layer could be compared with the IPsec AH and IPsec ESP while
   the Handshake protocol can be compared with the Internet Key Exchange
   Version 2 (IKEv2).  The provided security of the TLS Record Layer
   depends also, but not only, on the chosen ciphersuite algorithms;
   NULL encryption ciphersuites, like those specified in RFC 4785
   [RFC4785], offer only integrity- without confidentiality-protection.
   Example ciphersuites for the TLS Record Layer are RC4 with SHA1,
   AES128 with SHA1, AES256 with SHA1, RC4 with SHA1, RC4 with MD5

   It is worth mentioning that TLS may also be used without the TLS
   Record Layer.  This has, for example, been exercised with the work on
   the framework for establishing a Secure Real-time Transport Protocol
   (SRTP) security context using the Datagram Transport Layer Security
   (DTLS [RFC4347]) protocol (DTLS-SRTP [RFC5763]).

2.  Communication Relationships

   A security solution is strongly impacted by the communication
   relationships [RFC4101], which will have an impact on the code size.
   Having a good understanding of these relationships will be essential.

   Consider the following scenario where a smart meter transmits its
   energy readings to other parties.  The electricity company will want
   to make sure that the obtained meter readings can be attributed to a
   specific meter in a house hold.  Most electricity companies will find
   it unacceptable to have meter readings modified in transit or by a
   rogue endpoint (particularly if the attack leads to a disadvantage,
   for example financial loss, for the electricity provider).  Users in
   a house hold may want to ensure that only certain parties get to see
   the meter readings; privacy concerns come to mind.

   In this example a sensor may need to only ever talk to servers of a
   specific electricity company or even only to a single pre-configured
   server.  Clearly, some information has to be pre-provisioned into the
   device to ensure the desired behavior to talk only to selected
   servers.  The meter may be configured with the domain name used by
   the electricity company and with the root certificate that is used by
   the electricity company to sign certificates for their servers.  The
   device may, however, also be configured to accept one or multiple
   server certificates.  It may even be pre-provisioned with the
   server's raw public key, or a shared secret instead of relying on
   certificates.

   Lowering the flexibility decreases the implementation overhead.  TLS-
   PSK [RFC4279], in case of shared secret usage, or raw public keys
   used with TLS [I-D.ietf-tls-oob-pubkey] require fewer lines of code
   than x509 certificate usage, as it will be explained later in this
   document.  A decision for constraining the client-side TLS
   implementation, for example by offering only a single ciphersuite,
   has to made in awareness of what functionality will be available on
   the TLS server-side.  In certain communication environments it may be
   easy to influence both communication partners while in other cases
   the existing deployment needs to be taken into consideration.

   To illustrate another example, consider an Internet radio, which
   allows a user to connect to available radio stations, will be more
   constrained than an IP-enabled scale that connects only to the Web
   server offered by the manufacturer of that device.  A threat
   assessment may even lead to the conclusion that TLS support is not
   necessary at all.

   Consider the following extension to our earlier scenario where the
   meter is attached to a home WLAN network and the interworking with

   WLAN security mechanisms need to be taken care of.  On top of the
   link layer authentication a transport layer or application layer
   security mechanism needs to be implemented.  Quite likely the
   security mechanisms will be different due to the different credential
   requirements.  While there is a possibility for re-use of
   cryptographic libraries (such as the SHA-1, MD5, or HMAC) the overall
   code footprint will very likely be larger.

3.  Design Decisions

   To evaluate the required TLS functionality a couple of high level
   design decisions have to be made:

   o  What type of protection for the data traffic is required?  Is
      confidentiality protection in addition to integrity protection
      required?  Many TLS ciphersuites also provide a variant for NULL
      encryption.  If confidentiality protection is demanded a carefully
      chosen set of algorithms may have a positive impact on the code
      size.  For example, the RC4 stream cipher code size is 1,496 bytes
      compared to 7,096 bytes for AES usage.  Re-use of crypto-libraries
      (within TLS but also among the entire protocol stack) will also
      help to reduce the overall code size.

   o  What functionality is available in hardware?  For example, certain
      hardware platforms offer support for a random number generator as
      well as cryptographic algorithms (e.g., AES).  These functions can
      be re-used and allow to reduce the amount of required code.

   o  What credentials for client and server authentication are
      required: passwords, pre-shared secrets, certificates, raw public
      keys (or a mixture of them)?  Is certificate handling necessary?
      If not, then the ASN.1 library as well as the certificate parsing
      and processing can be omitted.  If pre-shared secrets are used
      then the big integer implementation can be omitted.

   o  What TLS version and what TLS features, such as session
      resumption, can or have to be used?

   o  Is a client-side stack of TLS needed only or is also the server-
      side implementation necessary as well?

   o  Is it possible to hardwire credentials into the code rather than
      loading them from storage?  If so, then no file handling or
      parsing of the credentials is needed and the credentials are
      already available in form that they can be used within the TLS
      implementation.

4.  Conclusion

   The IAB published a document, RFC 5218 [RFC5218], on the success
   criteria for protocols.  A "wildly successful" protocol far exceeds
   its original goals, in terms of purpose (being used in scenarios far
   beyond the initial design), in terms of scale (being deployed on a
   scale much greater than originally envisaged), or both.  TLS is an
   example of such a wildly successful protocol.  It can be tailored to
   fit the needs of a specific deployment environment.  This
   customization property offers the basis for a relatively small code
   footprint.  The communication model and the security goals will,
   however, ultimately decide about the resulting code size; this is not
   only true for TLS but for every security solution.

   More flexibility and more features will translate to a bigger
   footprint.  Generic complains about the large size of TLS stacks are
   not useful and should be accompanied by a description of the assumed
   functionality.  To support the author's opinion this position paper
   provides information about the amount of required code for various
   functions and considers most recent work from the IETF TLS working
   group for the support of raw public keys.

   The author is convinced that TLS is a suitable security protocol
   (with the standardized extensions) for usage in many smart object
   deployments.  Only minor extensions, as currently being developed in
   the IETF TLS working group, are needed to support an even large set
   of use cases.  There are, however, cases where the security goals ask
   for a security solution other than TLS.  With the wide range of smart
   object applications it is impractical to design for a single security
   architecture or even a single communication architecture.
