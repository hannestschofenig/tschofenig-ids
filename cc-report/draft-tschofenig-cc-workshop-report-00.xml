    <abstract>
      <t>This document provides a summary of the IAB/IRTF Workshop on 'Congestion Control for Interactive Real-Time Communication', which took place in Vancouver, Canada, on July 28, 2012. The main goal of the workshop was to foster a discussion on congestion control mechanisms for interactive real-time communication. This report summarizes the discussions and lists the conclusions and recommendations to the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) community. The views and positions in this report are those of the workshop participants and do not necessarily reflect the views and positions of the authors, the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) or the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF).</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Any application that sends significant amounts of data over the Internet is expected to implement reasonable congestion control behavior. Although the specific mechanisms depend on the application or protocol, the motivations for congestion control are well understood and documented in RFC 2914 <xref target="RFC2914"/> and RFC 5405  <xref target="RFC5405"/>. The goals are:
<list style="numbers">
<t>Preventing congestion collapse.</t>
<t>Allowing multiple flows to share the network fairly.</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>
The Internet has been used for interactive real-time communication for decades, most of which is being transmitted using RTP over UDP, often over provisioned capacity and/or using only rudimentary congestion control mechanisms.</t>

<t>The development and upcoming widespread deployment of web-based real-time media communication - where RTP is used to and from web browsers to transmit audio, video and data - will likely result in substantial new Internet traffic. Due to the projected volume of this traffic, as well as the fact that it is more likely to use unprovisioned capacity, it is essential that it is transmitted with robust and effective congestion control mechanisms.</t>

<t>Designing congestion control mechanisms that perform well under a wide variety of traffic mixes and over network paths with widely varying characteristics is not easy. Prevention of congestion collapse can be achieved through "circuit breaker" mechanisms, but for media flows that are supposed to coexist with a user's other ongoing communication sessions, a congestion control mechanism that shares capacity fairly in the presence of a mix of TCP, UDP and other protocol flows is needed.</t>

<t>Many additional complications arise. Here are some examples:
<list style="numbers">
<t>Real-time interactive media sessions require low latencies, whereas streaming media can use large play-out buffers.</t>
<t>RTCP feedback about an RTP session typically arrives much less frequently than, for example, TCP ACKs for a given TCP connection. The RTP/RTCP control loop can lead to a longer reaction time.</t>
<t>Media codecs can usually only adjust their output rates in a much more coarse-grained fashion than, for example, TCP, and user experience suffers if encoding rates are switched too frequently. Codecs typically have a minimum sending rate as well.</t>
<t>Some bits of an encoded media stream are more important than others. For example, losing or dropping an I-frame of a video stream is more problematic than dropping a P-frame.</t>
<t>Ramping up the transmission rate can be problematic. Simply increasing the output rate of the codec without knowledge whether the network path can sustain transmission at the increased rate runs the danger of incurring a significant amount of packet loss that can cause playback artifacts.</t>
<t>A congestion control scheme for interactive media needs to handle bundles of interrelated flows (audio, video, data), in a way that accommodates the preferences of the application in the event of congestion.</t>
<t>The desire to provide a congestion control mechanism that can be efficiently implemented inside an application (e.g., a web server and a browser) imposes additional restrictions.</t>
<t>There are explicit congestion signals (such as ECN), and there are indirect indications of congestion (such as packet delay and loss). However, congestion is not the only source of these indirect signals. Care must be taken to account for each of these signals, particularly if various applications react on the same signals.</t>
<t>Network elements and end device operating systems often create buffers to better support TCP-based applications. These buffers introduce additional communication delay, which harms the small delay budget available for real-time applications.</t>
</list>

    </section>

    <section title="History and Current Status">
<t>The currently deployed RTP-based RTC systems use congestion control schemes that are ad hoc at best. As the Internet moves towards an RTCWeb standard for interoperable audio/video conferencing, it needs a standardized and most importantly effective mechanism for congestion control.</t>

<t>The most immediate need is for a circuit breaker mechanism that stops a flow when serious anomalies are detected, i.e., when it is using an order of magnitude more bandwidth than a TCP flow would use over the given path <xref target="I-D.perkins-avtcore-rtp-circuit-breakers"/>. This prevents the RTCWeb flows from causing long lasting gross over-utilization of the network. Circuit breakers can prevent congestion collapse if used correctly, i.e., if the circuit remains disabled for some time after the breaker triggers, but do not in any way enable concurrent flows to share available network capacity sensibly.</t>

<t>Therefore, in addition to circuit breakers, more complete methods for media congestion control are needed. The focus of the workshop was on discussing ideas for these more complete congestion control methods.Note that the primary focus of the workshop is RTCWeb-style audio/video flows. The assumed underlying flows (in most attendees minds) were digital audio/video data encapsulate in RTP over UDP over IP. Most of the concepts presented at the workshop could be used with different media types over different transports, but this was the generally assumed baseline for discussions.</t>
    </section>
	
	<section title="Recommendations">
	<t>The participants suggested to explore two complementary solution tracks, as described in the two sub-sections below.</t>
	
	<section title="Changes to Network Infrastructure"> 

	<t>Like for all other traffic on the network, better data plane infrastructure improves the perceived quality of the best-effort service the Internet provides for RTCWeb flows. The IETF has already developed several technologies that would be of immediate usefulness, if they were deployed. The workshop participants expressed the hope that due to the volume and importance of RTCWeb traffic, some of these technologies might finally see widespread use.</t>
	
	<t>The first and by far most important improvement is traffic segregation, i.e., the ability to use different queues for different traffic types. Specifically jitter/delay sensitive and throughput maximizing protocols need to be in different queues. It is not possible for a single queue/AQM to be optimal for both.</t>

<t>Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) allows routers along the end-to-end path to signal the onset of congestion and allows applications to respond early, avoiding losses and keep queue sizes short and therefore end-to-end delay low. ECN is not widely implemented on end system stacks and on routers, but it is implemented it is frequently not enabled.</t>

<t>Different mechanisms have been developed to facilitate traffic segregation. Differentiated services are one possibility in this space if applications start to mark outgoing traffic appropriately and routers would segregate traffic accordingly, browsers could more directly control the relative importance of their various flows, and avoid self-competition. Compared to ECN, however, DiffServ is far more difficult to deploy meaningfully end-to-end, especially given that DSCPs have no defined end-to-end meaning and packets can be re-marked. Quality-of-service (QoS) signaling together with resource reservation facilities would enable a fine-grained and flexible way to indicate resource needs to network elements but it is also by far the most heavyweight proposal.</t>

<t>However, any change to network infrastructure will take time particularly if the interest of the involved stakeholders is not aligned (as it is the case for network operators and over-the-top application providers). It is therefore imperative that an RTCWeb congestion control provides some improvement work at least adequately in the absence of any ofthese schemes.</t>

	</section> 
	
	
	<section title="Avoiding Self-Inflicted Queuing"> 
	
	<t>This approach tries to ensure that the network does not get congested. This is of course difficult to accomplish for a single end host by itself. As such, the focus of this solution track on congestion control for real-time media is about data that is transmitted by a single browsers, single application, or at best by a single end host.</t>
	
	<t>The following activities were suggested during the workshop.</t>
	<t>
	<list style="symbols">
	  <t>Need algorithm that reacts to all signals. Feedback signals come in various forms:
     	<list style="symbols">
        <t>RTCP reports, delay, loss, correlation between signal and jitter, etc.</t>
        <t>Use explicit congestion signal, if available, such as ECN.</t>
        </list>
      </t>
	  <t>Achieve low latency with algorithm design:
        <list style="symbols">
        <t>Delay based algorithms are needed in this mode. There is a wide range of normal delay variation in a non-congested networks and investigation is needed to get an idea about the range to design delay based algorithms.</t>
        <t>Need not to fail when competing with TCP in case of losses.</t>
	    </list>
      </t>
	  <t>Congestion control algorithms should be evaluated under realistic loss and delay conditions to be sure that the desired audio/video rates are attainable using the proposed algorithms for the desired service.</t>  
      <t>A congestion controller needs to be aware that media is inherently variable and it may be possible to associate the current congestion situation with the currently chosen encoding. However, investigation is need to decide what information (if any) needs to be exchanged between the codec and the congestion control algorithm. Codecs have room for adaptation but it is often limited.

	</list> 
	</t>
	
	<t>In addition, there were some discussions on how to make RTCWeb-style flows fair to other RTCWeb-style flows, other TCP based flows, LEDBAT flows, and other flows. This is a much more difficult problem than simply making RTCWeb flows avoid congestion.</t>
	
	<t>The following topics also fall into short term deployment time-frame
     	<list style="symbols">
          <t>Change the way TCP is used in browsers. For example , avoid opening too many concurrent TCP connections, improved interworking with video streaming and file sharing software.</t>
