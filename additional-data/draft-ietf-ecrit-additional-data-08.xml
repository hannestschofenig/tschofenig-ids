			<t>When an emergency call is sent to a Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP),

		<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">

		<t>When an emergency call is triggered and the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is used a rich set of data is conveyed to the  
           Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) already as part of the call setup, which includes information about the calling party 
		   identity, the multimedia capabilities of the device, the emergency service number, etc. The device, as well as any service 
		   provider in the path may have even more information that may be useful for a PSAP call taker. This document extends the 
		   basic signaling of an emergency call, as described in <xref target="RFC6443"/> and <xref target="RFC6881"/>, in order 
		   to carry additional data which may be useful to an entity handling the call.  This data is "additional" to the basic 
		   information found in the emergency call signaling used.</t>
		   
			<t>Three general categories of such data are defined, namely data about the call, the location and the caller. 
			In more detail, the three types of data exchanged are:

				<list style="hanging"> 
				
					<t hangText="Data Associated with a Call:">While information is carried in the call setup procedure itself 
					(as part of the SIP headers as well as in the body of the SIP message), there is additional data known by the 
					device making the call, or a service provider in the path of the call.  This information may include the identity
                    and contact information of the service provider, subscriber identity and contact
                    information, the type of service the provider offers, what kind of device is being used, etc. Some data is device or 
					service dependent data. For example, a car telematics system or service may have crash information. A medical monitoring
                    device may have sensor data. While the details of the information may vary by device or service, there needs to be a 
					common way to send such data to a PSAP. </t>
		
					<t hangText="Data Associated with a Location:">Location data is conveyed in the Presence Informatoin Data Format 
					Location Object (PIDF-LO) data structure originally defined in RFC 4119 <xref target="RFC4119"/>. There may be 
					data that is specific to the location not available in the location data structure itself, such as floor plans, 
					tenant and building owner contact data, Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) status, etc.</t>
		
		            <t hangText="Data Associated with a Caller:">This is personal data about a caller, such as medical information and 
					emergency contact data.</t>
				</list> 
			</t>

			<t>This document only defines data structures relevant to data associated with the call.  Other forms of additional data may use 
			this mechanism to carry data, but those blocks are not defined in this document.</t>
			
			<t>Data structures are defined for such data, and a means of conveying the data by including a Uniform Resource Identifier 
			(URI) in an existing SIP header field, the Call-Info header, which is specified in Section 20.9 of <xref target="RFC3261"/>. 
             For this purpose a new token, namely 'emergencyCallData' is defined to be carried in the "purpose" parameter.  If the 
			 "purpose" parameter is set to 'emergencyCallData' then the Call-Info header contains a HTTPS URL that resolves to a data
             structure with information about the call, or is a CID (content indirection) that allows the data structure to be placed 
			 in the body of the message. The "purpose" parameter also contains an indication of what kind of data is available at the URI.
             As such, the additional data may reside on an external database, or may be contained within the body of the SIP message.</t>

            <t><xref target="example"/> shows a SIP INVITE example containing such a Call-Info header using the purpose parameter.</t>
			
			<t>Besides a service provider in the path of a call, the access network provider (which may provide location in the form of 
			a PIDF-LO <xref target="RFC4119"/> from a location server via a location configuration protocol) also has similar information
			that may be valuable to the PSAP.  This information is not specific to the location itsef, but rather provides descriptive 
			information having to do with the immediate circumstances about the provision of the location (who the access network is, 
			how to contact that entity, what kind of service the access network provides, subscriber information, etc.).  This data is 
			similar in nearly every respect to the data known by service providers in the path of the call.  When the access network 
			provider and service provider are separate entities, the access network does not participate in the application layer signaling 
			(and hence cannot add a Call-Info' header field to the SIP message), but may provide location information to assist in 
			locating the caller's device.  The 'provided-by' element of the PIDF-LO is a mechanism for the access network to supply the 
			information about the entity or organization that supplied this location information. For this reason, this document describes 
			a namespace per <xref target="RFC4119"/> for inclusion in the "provided-by" element of a PIDF-LO for adding information known 
			to the access network.</t>

			<t>More technically, the data structure described in this document is represented as one or more "blocks" of information. 
			Each of the blocks is a Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) type, and an extensible set of these types constitute 
			the data set. A registry is defined to list the block types that may be included.  
			</t>
			<!-- 
			<t>Devices or services may have data useful to PSAPs and emergency responders that is specific to the type of device or service providing the data.  An example is telematics data available from vehicles equipped with sensors and mechanisms to provide the sensor data (for example, the VEDS data set).  The mechanism described in this document can be used to provide such data by defining a MIME type and including a reference to the data in the Call-Info header.  PSAPS and emergency responders have to be prepared in advance to handle such data, and may or may not choose to accept it.  To control the types of data a PSAP or responder may encounter using this mechanism, a registry of data sets is created by this document.  The registry allows the PSAP, responder, or entity processing the 
call to identify in advance the types of data it is prepared to 
accept, and fetch or access only those types.</t>

		<section title="Terminology">
			<t> The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD
        NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
        described in <xref target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>
<!-- 			<t>The term "Service Provider" is used throughout this document as a service entity in the path of an emergency call (such as a carrier or a relay service) or the access infrastructure provider who may provide location.</t> -->
		
			<t>This document also uses terminology from <xref target="RFC5012"/>. 
   We use the term service provider to refer to an Application Service Provider (ASP) or to Voice Service Provider (VSP), which is a specific type of ASP. With the term "Access Network Provider" we refer to the Internet
   Access Provider (IAP) and the Internet Service Provider (ISP) without further distinguishing these two entities, since the difference between the two is not relevant for this document. Note that the roles of ASP and access network provider may be provided by a single company.</t>
   
   	<t>In the data block definitions, the "Use:" values are specified as one of:
				<list style="hanging">
					<t hangText="'Mandatory':"> means they must be present in the data structure.</t>
					<t hangText="'Conditional':"> means they must be present unless the specified condition is met, in which case the they may be present.</t>
					<t hangText="'Optional':"> means they may be present.</t>
				</list>
			</t>
			
		</section>

		<!-- ******************************************************************************* -->
		<section title="Data Structure Overview">
			<t>The following section defines an initial set of blocks which may be sent by value or by reference in SIP signaling or within a PIDF-LO. For each block, we define the MIME type, and the XML data structure for the block. The following blocks are defined:
				<list style="hanging">
					<t hangText="'Data Provider':"> This block supplies name and contact information for the entity that created the data.</t>
					<t hangText="'Service Information':">  This block supplies information about the service provided by a service provider.</t>
					<t hangText="'Device Information':">  This block supplies information about the device placing the call.</t>
					<t hangText="'Owner/Subscriber':">  This block supplies information about the owner of the device or about the subscriber of the application service.</t>
					<t hangText="'Comment':">  This block provides a way to supply free form human readable text to the PSAP or emergency responders.</t>
				</list>
			</t>

			<t>PSAPs and emergency responders can examine the type of data provided and selectively retrieve the data each they are interested in, while forwarding all of it (the values or references) to downstream entities.</t>

			<t>Blocks can be sent by value (the data in the SIP body or PIDF-LO) or by reference (the data is retrieved via HTTPS from an external server).  Data may be provided by the device and/or one or more service providers.  For example, the device may provide device specific information by value, a telematics service provider may provide its contact data and data derived from the sensor data (e.g., injury prediction) by reference, and an access network provider may provide contact information by value, all in the same SIP INVITE.</t>

			<t>The access network provider may supply additional data as well, by including the data within a Provided-By element of a PDIF-LO it returns for emergency use (e.g., if requested with a HELD "responseTime" attribute of "emergencyRouting" or "emergencyDispatch" <xref target="RFC5985"/>). Access network providers are expected to normally supply such information by reference (by including an HTTPS URI within the Provided-By element). This document defines a namespace and adds the namespace to
   the "provided-by" registry defined by PIDF-LO <xref target="RFC4119"/>.</t>

		</section>

		<section title="Transmitting Blocks of Additional Data" anchor="transmitting_blocks">

			<t>One or more blocks of data registered in the Emergency Call Additional Data registry, as defined in 
				<xref target="RegCreate"/>, may be included or referenced in the SIP signaling (using the Call-Info header field) or in the provided-by 
     element of a PIDF-LO.  Each block is a MIME type, and any set of blocks may be included.</t>

			<t>Additional data about a call is defined as a series of MIME objects, each with an XML data 
   structure contained inside.  As usual, whenever more than one MIME part is included in the 
body of a message, MIME-multipart (i.e., 'multipart/mixed') encloses 
them all.  The sections below define the XML schema and MIME types used for each 
block.  When additional data is passed by value in the SIP signaling, each CID URL points to one block in the body.  Multiple URIs are used within a Call-Info header field (or multiple Call-Info header fields) to point to multiple blocks.  When additional data is provided by reference (in SIP signaling or Provided-By), each HTTPS URL references one block; the data is retrieved with an HTTP GET operation, which returns one of the blocks as an XML object.  
			</t>
			
			<t>A registry of allowed types is created by this document.  Every block must be one of the types in the registry.</t>

			<t>In regions where callers can elect to suppress certain personally identifying information, the network or PSAP functionality can inspect privacy flags within the SIP headers to determine what information may be passed, stored, or displayed to comply with local policy or law.</t>
			
			<t>Each entity adding additional data MUST supply the "Data Provider" block.  All other blocks are optional, but each entity SHOULD supply any blocks where it has at least some of the information in the block.</t>

			<section title="Transmitting blocks using Call-Info" anchor="using-call-info">
				<t>A URI to
   a block MAY be inserted in a SIP request or response method (most often INVITE or MESSAGE)
   with a Call-Info header field containing a purpose of "emergencyCallData" together with the type of data available at the URI.  The type of data is denoted by including the root of the MIME type (not including the emergencyCall prefix and the +xml suffix) with a "." separator.  For example, when referencing a block with MIME type 
'application/emergencyCall.ProviderInfo+xml', the 'purpose' parameter 
is set to 'emergencyCallData.ProviderInfo'.  An example "Call-Info" 
header field for this would be:
				</t>

				<t>
					<list style="hanging" hangIndent="4">
						<t hangText="Call-Info:">
     https://www.example.com/23sedde3; purpose="emergencyCallData.ProviderInfo"
						</t>
					</list>
				</t>

				<t>
   The Call-info header with purpose='emergencyCallData' MUST only be sent on an emergency
        call, which can be ascertained by the presence of an emergency service urn in a Route header
        of a SIP message. 
				</t><t>
    If the data is provided by reference, it may be retrieved with an
   HTTPS GET from the URI.  The URI MUST specify an HTTPS scheme, and consequently
   Transport Layer Security (TLS) protection is applied.</t>

				<t>The data may also be supplied by value in a SIP message.
   In this case, Content Indirection (CID) <xref target="RFC2392"/> is used, with the CID URL referencing the MIME body part.
				</t>

				<t> More than one Call-Info header with an emergencyCallData purpose can be expected, but at least one MUST be provided. 
The device MUST provide one if it knows no service provider is in the path of the call.  The
        device MAY insert one if it uses a service provider. Any service provider in the path of the call MUST insert its own. For example, a device, a telematics service provider in the call path, as well as the mobile carrier handling
        the call will each provide one.  There may be circumstances where there is a service provider who is unaware that the call is an emergency call and cannot reasonably be expected to determine that it is an emergency call.  In that case, that service provider is not expected to provide emergencyCallData.</t>

			</section>

			<section title="Transmitting blocks by reference using Provided-By">
				<t>
    The 'emergencyCallDataReference' element is used to transmit an additional data block by reference within a 'Provided-By' element of a PIDF-LO.  The 'emergencyCallDataReference' element has two attributes: 'ref' to specify the URL, and 'purpose' to indicate the type of data block referenced.  The value of 'ref' is an HTTPS URL that resolves to a data structure with information about the call.  The value of 'purpose' is the same as used in a 'Call-Info' header field (as specified in section <xref target="using-call-info"/>, <xref target="using-call-info" format="title"/>).
				</t>
				<t>
    For example, to reference a block with MIME type 
'application/emergencyCall.ProviderInfo+xml', the 'purpose' parameter 
is set to 'emergencyCallData.ProviderInfo'.  An example 'emergencyCallDataReference' element for this would be: 
				</t>
				<t>
					<list>
						<t>
        &lt;emergencyCallDataReference ref="https://www.example.com/23sedde3" purpose="emergencyCallData.ProviderInfo"/&gt;
						</t>
					</list>
				</t>
			</section>

			<section title="Transmitting blocks by value using Provided-By">
				<t>
    It is RECOMMENDED that access networks supply the data specified in this document by reference, but they MAY provide the data by value.
				</t>
				<t>
    The 'emergencyCallDataValue' element is used to transmit an additional data block by value within a 'Provided-By' element of a PIDF-LO.  The 'emergencyCallDataValue' element has one attribute: 'purpose' to indicate the type of data block contained.  The value of 'purpose' is the same as used in a 'Call-Info' header field (as specified in <xref target="using-call-info"/>, and in <xref target="using-call-info"/>).  The same XML structure as would be wrapped in the corresponding MIME type is placed inside the emergencyCallDataValue element.

						<t hangText="Description:">This data element defines the kind of device making
                the emergency call. If the device provides the data structure, the device 
                information SHOULD be provided.  If the service provider provides the  
                structure and it knows what the device is, the service provider SHOULD 
                provide the device information.  Often the carrier does not know what the 
                device is.  It is possible to receive two Additional Data Associated with a 
                Call data structures, one created by the device and one created by the 
                service provider.  This information describes the device, not 
                how it is being used.  This data element defines the kind of device making 
                the emergency call.  A registry will reflect the following valid entries:

			<section title="Choosing between defining a new type of block or new type of device/service specific additional data">
				<t>
      For devices that have device or service specific data, there are two choices to carry it.  A new block can be defined, or the device/service specific additional data URL the the DevInfo block can be used and a new type for it defined .  The data passed would likely be the same in both cases.  Considerations for choosing which mechanism to register under include:
					<list style="hanging">
						<t hangText="Applicability:">Information which will be carried by many kinds of devices or services are more appropriately defined as separate blocks.</t>
						<t hangText="Privacy:">Information which may contain private data may be better sent in the DevInfo block, rather than a new block so that implementations are not tempted to send the data by value, and thus having more exposure to the data than forcing the data to be retrieved via the URL in DevInfo.</t>
						<t hangText="Size:">Information which may be very may be better sent in the DevInfo block, rather than a new block so that implementations are not tempted to send the data by value.  Conversely, data which is small may best be sent in a separate block so that it can be sent by value</t>
						<t hangText="Availability of a server:">Providing the data via the device block requires a server be made available to retrieve the data.  Providing the data via new block allows it to be sent by value (CID).</t>

		<section anchor="mainTel" title="Main Telephone Number">
			<t>In a xCard, used extensively in this document, there is no way to specify a "Main" telephone number.  
			These numbers are useful to emergency responders who are called to a large enterprise.  
			This document adds a new Property Value to the "tel" property of the TYPE parameter called "main".  
			It can be used in any xCard in additional data.</t>

		<section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">

			<t>The information in this data structure will usually be considered private. HTTPS is
        specified to require the provider of the information to validate the credentials of the
        requester. While the creation of a PKI that has global scope may be difficult, the
        alternatives to creating devices and services that can provide critical information securely
        are more daunting.  The provider may enforce any policy it wishes to use, but PSAPs and responder agencies should deploy a PKI so that providers of additional data can check the certificate of the client and decide the appropriate policy to enforce based on that certificate.</t>

			<t>Ideally, the PSAP and emergency responders will be given credentials signed by an authority trusted by the data provider.  In most circumstances, nationally recognized credentials would be sufficient, and if the emergency services arranges a PKI, data providers could be provisioned with the root CA public key for a given nation.  Some nations are developing a PKI for this, and related, purposes.  Since calls could be made from devices where the device and/or the service provider(s) are not local to the emergency authorities, globally recognized credentials are useful.  This might be accomplished by extending the notion of the "forest guide" described in <xref target="RFC5222"/> to allow the forest guide to provide the credential of the PKI root for areas that it has coverage information for, but standards for such a mechanism are not yet available.  In its absence, the data provider will need to obtain the root CA credentials for any areas it is willing to provide additional data by out of band means. With the credential of the root CA for a national emergency services PKI, the data provider server can validate the credentials of an entity requesting additional data by reference.</t>
			<t>The data provider also needs a credential that can be verified by the emergency services to know that it is receiving data from the right server.  The emergency authorities could provide credentials, distinguishable from credentials it provides to emergency responders and PSAPs, which could be used to validate data providers.  Such credentials would have to be acceptable to any PSAP or responder that could receive a call with additional data supplied by that provider.  This would be extensible to global credential validation using the forest guide as above.  In the absence of such credentials, the emergency authorities could maintain a list of local data providers' credentials provided to it out of band.  At a minimum, the emergency authorities could obtain a credential from the DNS entry of the domain in the Addional Data URI to at least validate that the server is known to the domain providing the URI.</t>
			<t>Data provided by devices by reference have similar credential validation issues to service providers, and the solutions are the same.</t>

		<section anchor="privacy" title="Privacy Considerations"> 
			<t>There is much private data in this information. Local regulations	
			may govern what data must be provided in emergency calls, but in	
			general, the emergency call system is often aided by the kinds of	
			information described in this document. There is a tradeoff between	
			the privacy considerations and the utility of the data. Certainly,	
			if the data cannot be protected, due to failure to establish (by TLS) a 
			secure connection to the data provider, data SHOULD NOT be sent unless 
			specifically required by regulation.
			</t>
			<t>Some forms of data can be sent by value in the SIP signaling or by value (URL in SIP signaling).  
			When data is sent by value, all intermediaries have access to the data.  
			If the data is private, sending by reference is more appropriate.</t>
