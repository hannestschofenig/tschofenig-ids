              Additional Data related to an Emergency Call
                draft-ietf-ecrit-additional-data-19.txt

Abstract

   When an emergency call is sent to a Public Safety Answering Point
   (PSAP), the device that sends it, as well as any application service
   provider in the path of the call, or access network provider through
   which the call originated may have information about the call, the
   caller or the location which the PSAP may be able to use.  This
   document describes data structures and a mechanism to convey such
   data to the PSAP.  The mechanism uses a Uniform Resource Identifier
   (URI), which may point to either an external resource or an object in
   the body of the SIP message.  The mechanism thus allows the data to
   be passed by reference (when the URI points to an external resource)
   or by value (when it points into the body of the message).  This
   follows the tradition of prior emergency services standardization
   work where data can be conveyed by value within the call signaling
   (i.e., in body of the SIP message) and also by reference.

1.  Introduction

   When an IP-based emergency call is initiated, a rich set of data from
   multiple data sources is conveyed to the Public Safety Answering
   Point (PSAP).  This data includes information about the calling party
   identity, the multimedia capabilities of the device, the emergency
   service number, location information, and meta-data about the sources
   of the data.  The device, the access network provider, and any
   service provider in the call path may have even more information
   useful for a PSAP.  This document extends the basic set of data
   communicated with an IP-based emergency call, as described in
   [RFC6443] and [RFC6881], in order to carry additional data which may
   be useful to an entity or call taker handling the call.  This data is
   "additional" to the basic information found in the emergency call
   signaling used.

   In general, there are three categories of this additional data that
   may be transmitted with an emergency call:

   Data Associated with a Location:  Primary location data is conveyed
      in the Presence Information Data Format Location Object (PIDF-LO)
      data structure as defined in RFC 4119 [RFC4119] and extended by
      RFC 5139 [RFC5139] and RFC 6848 [RFC6848] (for civic location

      information), RFC 5491 [RFC5491] and RFC 5962 [RFC5962] (for
      geodetic location information), and
      [I-D.ietf-geopriv-relative-location] (for relative location).
      This primary location data identifies the location or estimated
      location of the caller.  However, there may exist additional,
      secondary data which is specific to the location, such as floor
      plans, tenant and building owner contact data, heating,
      ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) status, etc.  Such
      secondary location data is not included in the location data
      structure but can be transmitted using the mechanisms defined in
      this document; although this document does not define any
      structures for such data, future documents may do so following the
      procedures defined here.

   Data Associated with a Call:  While some information is carried in
      the call setup procedure itself (as part of the SIP headers as
      well as in the body of the SIP message), there is additional data
      known by the device making the call and/or a service provider
      along the path of the call.  This information may include the
      service provider contact information, subscriber identity and
      contact information, the type of service the service provider and
      the access network provider offer, what type of device is being
      used, etc.  Some data is broadly applicable, while other data is
      dependent on the type of device or service.  For example, a
      medical monitoring device may have sensor data.  The data
      structures defined in this document (Data Provider Information,
      Device Information, and Owner/Subscriber Information) all fall
      into this category ("Data Associated with a Call").

   Data Associated with a Caller:  This is personal data about a caller,
      such as medical information and emergency contact data.  Although
      this document does not define any structures within this category,
      future documents may do so following the procedures defined here.

   While this document defines data structures only within the category
   of Data Associated with a Call, by establishing the overall framework
   of Additional Data, along with general mechanisms for transport of
   such data, extension points and procedures for future extensions, it
   minimizes the work needed to carry data in the other categories.
   Other specifications may make use of the facilities provided here.

   For interoperability, there needs to be a common way for the
   information conveyed to a PSAP to be encoded and identified.
   Identification allows emergency services authorities to know during
   call processing which types of data are present and to determine if
   they wish to access it.  A common encoding allows the data to be
   successfully accessed.

Internet-Draft            Additional Call Data             February 2014


   This document defines an extensible set of data structures, and
   mechanisms to transmit this data either by value or by reference,
   either in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) call signaling or in
   the Presence Information Data Format Location Object (PIDF-LO).  The
   data structures are usable by other communication systems and
   transports as well.  The data structures are defined in Section 3,
   and the transport mechanisms (using SIP and HTTPS) are defined in
   Section 4.

   Each data structure described in this document is encoded as a
   "block" of information.  Each block is an XML structure with an
   associated Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) type for
   identification within transport such as SIP and HTTPS.  The set of
   blocks is extensible.  Registries are defined to identify the block
   types that may be used and to allow blocks to be included in
   emergency call signaling.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   This document also uses terminology from [RFC5012].  We use the term
   service provider to refer to an Application Service Provider (ASP).
   A Voice Service Provider (VSP) is a special type of ASP.  With the
   term "Access Network Provider" we refer to the Internet Access
   Provider (IAP) and the Internet Service Provider (ISP) without
   further distinguishing these two entities, since the difference
   between the two is not relevant for this document.  Note that the
   roles of ASP and access network provider may be provided by a single
   company.

   Within each data block definition (see Section 3), the values for the
   "Use:" label are specified as one of the following:

   'Required':  means they MUST be present in the data structure.

   'Conditional':  means they MUST be present if the specified
      condition(s) is met.  They MAY be present if the condition(s) is
      not met.

   'Optional':  means they MAY be present.

   vCard is a data format for representing and exchanging a variety of
   information about individuals and other entities.  For applications
   that use XML the format defined in vCard is not immediately
   applicable.  For this purpose an XML-based encoding of the

Internet-Draft            Additional Call Data             February 2014


   information elements defined in the vCard specification has been
   defined and the name of that specification is xCard.  Since the term
   vCard is more familiar to most readers, we use the term xCard and
   vCard interchangeably.

3.  Data Structures

   This section defines the following five data structures, each as a
   data block.  For each block we define the MIME type, and the XML
   encoding.  The five data structures are:

   'Data Provider':  This block supplies name and contact information
      for the entity that created the data.  Section 3.1 provides the
      details.

   'Service Information':  This block supplies information about the
      service.  The description can be found in Section 3.2.

   'Device Information':  This block supplies information about the
      device placing the call.  Device information can be found in
      Section 3.3.

   'Owner/Subscriber':  This block supplies information about the owner
      of the device or about the subscriber.  Details can be found in
      Section 3.4.

   'Comment':  This block provides a way to supply free form human
      readable text to the PSAP or emergency responders.  This simple
      structure is defined in Section 3.5.

   Each block contains a mandatory <DataProviderReference> element.  The
   purpose of the <DataProviderReference> element is to associate all
   blocks added by the same data provider as a unit.  The
   <DataProviderReference> element associates the data provider block to
   each of the other blocks added as a unit.  Consequently, when a data
   provider adds additional data to an emergency call (such as device
   information) it MUST add information about itself (via the data
   provider block) and the blocks added contain the same value in the
   <DataProviderReference> element.  All blocks added by a single entity
   at the same time MUST have the same <DataProviderReference> value.
   The value of the <DataProviderReference> element has the same syntax
   and properties (specifically, world-uniqueness) as the value of the
   "Content-ID" message body header field specified in RFC 2045
   [RFC2045] except that the <DataProviderReference> element is not
   enclosed in brackets (the "<" and ">" symbols are omitted).  In other
   words, the value of an <DataProviderReference> element is
   syntactically an addr-spec as specified in RFC 822 [RFC0822].

Internet-Draft            Additional Call Data             February 2014


   Note that the xCard format is re-used in some of the data structures
   to provide contact information.  In an xCard there is no way to
   specify a "main" telephone number.  These numbers are useful to
   emergency responders who are called to a large enterprise.  This
   document adds a new property value to the "tel" property of the TYPE
   parameter called "main".  It can be used in any xCard in additional
   data.

3.1.  Data Provider Information

   This block is intended to be supplied by any service provider in the
   path of the call or the access network provider.  It includes
   identification and contact information.  This block SHOULD be
   supplied by every service provider in the call path, and by the
   access network provider.  Devices MAY use this block to provide
   identifying information.  The MIME subtype is "application/
   EmergencyCallData.ProviderInfo+xml".  An access network provider
   SHOULD provide this block either by value or by reference in the
   Provided-By section of a PIDF-LO

3.1.1.  Data Provider String

   Data Element:  Data Provider String

   Use:  Required

   XML Element:  <DataProviderString>

   Description:  This is a plain text string suitable for displaying the
      name of the service provider that supplied the data structure.  If
      the device creates the structure, it SHOULD use the value of the
      contact header in the SIP INVITE.

   Reason for Need:  Inform the call taker of the identity of the entity
      providing the data.

   How Used by Call Taker:  Allows the call taker to interpret the data
      in this structure.  The source of the information often influences
      how the information is used, believed or verified.

3.1.2.  Data Provider ID

   Data Element:  Data Provider ID

   Use:  Conditional.  This data SHOULD be provided if the service
      provider or access provider is located in a jurisdiction that
      maintains such IDs.  For example, in North America, this would be
      a NENA Company ID.

   XML Element:  <ProviderID>

   Description:  A jurisdiction-specific code for the access network
      provider or service provider shown in the <DataProvidedBy> element
      that created the structure.  NOTE: In the US, the provider's NENA
      Company ID MUST appear here.  Additional information can be found
      at NENA Company Identifier Program [1] or NENA Company ID [2].
      The NENA Company ID MUST be in the form of a URI in the following
      format: urn:nena:companyid:<NENA Company ID>

   Reason for Need:  Inform the call taker of the identity of the entity
      providing the data.

   How Used by Call Taker:  Where jurisdictions have lists of providers
      the Data Provider ID provides useful information about the data
      source.

3.1.3.  Data Provider ID Series

   Data Element:  Data Provider ID Series

   Use:  Conditional.  If Data Provider ID is provided, Data Provider ID
      Series is required.

   XML Element:  <ProviderIDSeries>

   Description:  Identifies the issuer of the ProviderId.  The Provider
      ID Series Registry (see Section 9.1) initially contains the
      following valid entries:

   +------------------------------+------------------------------------+

               Figure 1: Type of Data Provider ID Registry.

   Reason for Need:  Identifies the category of data provider.

   How Used by Call Taker:  This information may be helpful when
      deciding whom to contact when further information is needed.

3.1.5.  Data Provider Contact URI

   Data Element:  Data Provider Contact URI

   Use:  Required

   XML Element:  <ContactURI>

   Description:  When provided by a service provider or an access
      network provider, this information MUST be a URI to a 24/7 support
      organization tasked to provide PSAP support for this emergency
      call.  If the call is from a device, this SHOULD be the contact
      information of the owner of the device.  If a telephone number is
      the contact address then it MUST be a tel URI.  If it is provided
      as a SIP URI then it MUST be in the form of
      sip:telephonenumber@serviceprovider:user=phone.  Note that this

Internet-Draft            Additional Call Data             February 2014


      contact information is not used by PSAPs for callbacks (a call
      from a PSAP directly related to a recently terminated emergency
      call, placed by the PSAP using a SIP Priority header field set to
      "psap-callback", as described in [I-D.ietf-ecrit-psap-callback]).

   Reason for Need:  Additional data providers may need to be contacted
      in error cases or other unusual circumstances.

   How Used by Call Taker:  To contact the supplier of the additional
      data for assistance in handling the call.

3.1.6.  Data Provider Languages(s) Supported

   Data Element:  Data Provider Language(s) supported

   Use:  Required.

   XML Element:  <Language>

   Description:  The language used by the entity at the Data Provider
      Contact URI, as an alpha 2-character code as defined in ISO
      639-1:2002 Codes for the representation of names of languages --
      Part 1: Alpha-2 code Multiple instances of this element may occur.
      Order is significant; preferred language should appear first.  The
      content MUST reflect the languages supported at the contact URI.

      Note that the 'language' media feature tag, defined in RFC 3840
      [RFC3840] and the more extensive language negotiation mechanism
      proposed with [I-D.gellens-negotiating-human-language] are
      independent of this data provider language indication.

   Reason for Need:  This information indicates if the emergency service
      authority can directly communicate with the service provider or if
      an interpreter will be needed.

   How Used by Call Taker:  If call taker cannot speak language(s)
      supported by the service provider, a translation service will need
      to be added to the conversation.  Alternatively, other persons at
      the PSAP, besides the call taker, might be consulted for help
      (depending on the urgency and the type of interaction).

3.1.7.  xCard of Data Provider

   Data Element:  xCard of Data Provider

   Use:  Optional

   XML Element:  <DataProviderContact>

Internet-Draft            Additional Call Data             February 2014


   Description:  There are many fields in the xCard and the creator of
      the data structure is encouraged to provide as much information as
      they have available.  N, ORG, ADR, TEL, EMAIL are suggested at a
      minimum.  N SHOULD contain the name of the support group or device
      owner as appropriate.  If more than one TEL property is provided,
      a parameter from the vCard Property Value registry MUST be
      specified on each TEL.  For encoding of the xCard this
      specification uses the XML-based encoding specified in [RFC6351],
      referred to in this document as "xCard"

   Reason for Need:  Information needed to determine additional contact
      information.

   How Used by Call Taker:  Assists call taker by providing additional
      contact information that may not be included in the SIP invite or
      the PIDF-LO.

3.1.8.  Subcontractor Principal

   Data Element:  Subcontractor Principal

   Use:  Conditional.  This data is required if the Data Provider type
      is subcontractor.

   XML Element:  <SubcontratorPrincipal>

   Description:  Some providers outsource their obligations to handle
      aspects of emergency services to specialized providers.  If the
      data provider is a subcontractor to another provider this element
      contains the DataProviderString of the service provider to
      indicate which provider the subcontractor is working for.

   Reason for Need:  Identify the entity the subcontractor works for.

   How Used by Call Taker:  Allows the call taker to understand what the
      relationship between data providers and the service providers in
      the path of the call are.

3.1.9.  Subcontractor Priority

   Data Element:  Subcontractor Priority

   Use:  Conditional.  This element is required if the Data Provider
      type is set to "Subcontractor".

   XML Element:  <SubcontractorPriority>

Internet-Draft            Additional Call Data             February 2014


   Description:  If the subcontractor has to be contacted first then
      this element MUST have the value "sub".  If the provider the
      subcontractor is working for has to be contacted first then this
      element MUST have the value "main".

   Reason for Need:  Inform the call taker whom to contact first, if
      support is needed.

   How Used by Call Taker:  To decide which entity to contact first if
      assistance is needed.

             Figure 2: EmergencyCallData.ProviderInfo Example.

3.2.  Service Information

   This block describes the service that the service provider provides
   to the caller.  It SHOULD be included by all SPs in the path of the
   call.  The mime subtype is "application/
   EmergencyCallData.ServiceInfo+xml".

3.2.1.  Service Environment

   Data Element:  Service Environment

   Use:  Required

   XML Element:  <SvcEnvironment>

   Description:  This element defines whether a call is from a business
      or residence caller.  Currently, the only valid entries are
      'Business' or 'Residence'.  New values can be defined via the
      registry created in Figure 22.

   Reason for Need:  To assist in determining equipment and manpower
      requirements.

   How Used by Call Taker:  Information may be used to assist in
      determining equipment and manpower requirements for emergency
      responders.  As the information is not always available, and the
      registry is not all encompassing, this is at best advisory
      information, but since it mimics a similar capability in some
      current emergency calling systems, it is known to be valuable.
      The service provider uses its best information (such as a rate
      plan, facilities used to deliver service or service description)

      to determine the information and is not responsible for
      determining the actual characteristics of the location where the
      call originates from.

3.2.2.  Service Delivered by Provider to End User

   Data Element:  Service Delivered by Provider to End User

   Use:  Required

   XML Element:  <SvcDelByProvider>

   Description:  This defines the type of service the end user has
      subscribed to.  The implied mobility of this service cannot be
      relied upon.  A registry with an initial set of values is defined
      in Figure 3.

      More than one value MAY be returned.  For example, a VoIP inmate
      telephone service is a reasonable combination.

   Reason for Need:  Knowing the type of service may assist the PSAP
      with the handling of the call.

   How Used by Call Taker:  Call takers often use this information to
      determine what kinds of questions to ask callers, and how much to
      rely on supportive information.  An emergency call from a prison
      is treated differently that a call from a sensor device.  As the
      information is not always available, and the registry is not all
      encompassing, this is at best advisory information, but since it
      mimics a similar capability in some current emergency calling
      systems, it is known to be valuable.

3.2.3.  Service Mobility Environment

   Data Element:  Service Mobility Environment

   Use:  Required

   XML Element:  <SvcMobility>

   Description:  This provides the service providers view of the
      mobility of the caller.  As the service provider may not know the
      characteristics of the actual access network used, the value not
      be relied upon.  A registry will reflect the following initial
      valid entries:

      *  Mobile: the device should be able to move at any time

      *  Fixed: the device is not expected to move unless the service is
         relocated

      *  Nomadic: the device is not expected to change its point of
         attachment while on a call

Internet-Draft            Additional Call Data             February 2014


      *  Unknown: no information is known about the service mobility
         environment for the device

   Reason for Need:  Knowing the service provider's belief of mobility
      may assist the PSAP with the handling of the call.

   How Used by Call Taker:  To determine whether to assume the location
      of the caller might change.

3.3.  Device Information

   This block provides information about the device used to place the
   call.  It should be provided by any service provider that knows what
   device is being used, and by the device itself.  The mime subtype is
   "application/EmergencyCallData.DeviceInfo+xml".

3.3.1.  Device Classification

   Data Element:  Device Classification

   Use:  Optional

   XML Element:  <DeviceClassification>

   Description:  This data element defines the kind of device making the
      emergency call.  If the device provides the data structure, the
      device information SHOULD be provided.  If the service provider
      provides the structure and it knows what the device is, the
      service provider SHOULD provide the device information.  Often the
      carrier does not know what the device is.  It is possible to
      receive two Additional Data Associated with a Call data

      structures, one created by the device and one created by the
      service provider.  This information describes the device, not how
      it is being used.  This data element defines the kind of device
      making the emergency call.  The registry with the initial set of
      values is shown in Figure 5.

                 Figure 5: Device Classification Registry.

   Reason for Need:  The device classification implies the capability of
      the calling device and assists in identifying the meaning of the
      emergency call location information that is being presented.  For
      example, does the device require human intervention to initiate a
      call or is this call the result of programmed instructions?  Does
      the calling device have the ability to update location or
      condition changes?  Is this device interactive or a one-way
      reporting device?

Internet-Draft            Additional Call Data             February 2014


   How Used by Call Taker:  May assist with location of caller.  For
      example, a cordless handset may be outside or next door.  May
      provide the calltaker some context about the caller, the
      capabilities of the device used for the call or the environment
      the device is being used in.

3.3.2.  Device Manufacturer

   Data Element:  Device Manufacturer

   Use:  Optional

   XML Element:  <DeviceMfgr>

   Description:  The plain language name of the manufacturer of the
      device.

   Reason for Need:  Used by PSAP management for post-mortem
      investigation/resolution.

   How Used by Call Taker:  Probably not used by the calltaker, but by
      PSAP management.

3.3.3.  Device Model Number

   Data Element:  Device Model Number

   Use:  Optional

   XML Element:  <DeviceModelNr>

   Description:  Model number of the device.

   Reason for Need:  Used by PSAP management for after action
      investigation/resolution.

   How Used by Call Taker:  Probably not used by the calltaker, but by
      PSAP management.

3.3.4.  Unique Device Identifier

   Data Element:  Unique Device Identifier

   Use:  Optional

   XML Element:  <UniqueDeviceID>

   XML Attribute:  <TypeOfDeviceID>

Internet-Draft            Additional Call Data             February 2014


   Description:  A string that identifies the specific device making the
      call or creating an event.

      The <TypeOfDeviceID> attribute identifies the type of device
      identifier.  A registry with an initial set of values can be seen
      in Figure 6.

   +--------+----------------------------------------+
   | Token  | Description                            |
   +--------+----------------------------------------+
   | MEID   | Mobile Equipment Identifier  (CDMA)    |
   | ESN    | Electronic Serial Number(GSM)          |
   | MAC    | Media Access Control Address (IEEE)    |
   | WiMAX  | Device Certificate Unique ID           |

   +--------+----------------------------------------+

             Figure 6: Registry with Device Identifier Types.

   Reason for Need:  Uniquely identifies the device (independent of any
      signaling identifiers present in the call signaling stream).

   How Used by Call Taker:  Probably not used by the call taker; may be
      used by PSAP management during an investigation.

   Example:  <UniqueDeviceID TypeOfDeviceID="SN">12345</UniqueDeviceID>

3.3.5.  Device/Service Specific Additional Data Structure

   Data Element:  Device/service specific additional data structure

   Use:  Optional

   XML Element:  <DeviceSpecificData>

   Description:  A URI representing additional data whose schema is
      specific to the device or service which created it.  (For example,
      a medical device or medical device monitoring service may have a
      defined set of medical data.)  The URI, when dereferenced, MUST
      yield a data structure defined by the Device/service specific
      additional data type value.  Different data may be created by each
      classification; e.g., a medical device created data set.

   Reason for Need:  Provides device/service specific data that may be
      used by the call taker and/or responders.

Internet-Draft            Additional Call Data             February 2014


   How Used by Call Taker:  Provide information to guide call takers to
      select appropriate responders, give appropriate pre-arrival
      instructions to callers, and advise responders of what to be
      prepared for.  May be used by responders to guide assistance
      provided.

3.3.6.  Device/Service Specific Additional Data Structure Type

   Data Element:  Type of device/service specific additional data
      structure

   Use:  Conditional.  MUST be provided when device/service specific
      additional URI is provided

   XML Element:  <DeviceSpecificType>

   Description:  Value from a registry defined by this document to
      describe the type of data that can be retrieved from the device/
      service specific additional data structure.  Initial values are:

      *  IEEE 1512

      *  VEDS

      IEEE 1512 is the USDoT model for traffic incidents and VEDS
      provides data elements needed for an efficient emergency response
      to vehicular emergency incidents.

   Reason for Need:  This data element allows identification of
      externally defined schemas, which may have additional data that
      may assist in emergency response.

   How Used by Call Taker:  This data element allows the end user
      (calltaker or first responder) to know what type of additional
      data may be available to aid in providing the needed emergency
      services.

   Note:  Information which is specific to a location or a caller
      (person) should not be placed in this section.

3.3.7.  Issues with getting new types of data into use

   This document describes two mechanisms which allow extension of the
   kind of data provided with an emergency call: define a new block or
   define a new service specific additional data URL for the DeviceInfo
   block.  While defining new data types and getting a new device or
   application to send the new data may be easy, getting PSAPs and
   responders to actually retrieve the data and use it will be



Rosen, et al.            Expires August 15, 2014               [Page 22]

Internet-Draft            Additional Call Data             February 2014


   difficult.  New mechanism providers should understand that acquiring
   and using new forms of data usually require software upgrades at the
   PSAP and/or responders, as well as training of call takers and
   responders in how to interpret and use the information.  Legal and
   operational review may also be needed.  Overwhelming a call taker or
   responder with too much information is highly discouraged.  Thus, the
   barrier to supporting new data is quite high.

   The mechanisms this document describes are meant to encourage
   development of widely supported, common data formats for classes of
   devices.  If all manufacturers of a class of device use the same
   format, and the data can be shown to improve outcomes, then PSAPs and
   responders may be encouraged to upgrade their systems and train their
   staff to use the data.  Variations, however well intentioned, are
   unlikely to be supported.

   Implementers should consider that data from sensor-based devices in
   some cases may not be useful to call takers or PSAPs (and privacy or
   other considerations may preclude the PSAP from touching the data),
   but may be of use to responders.  Some standards being developed by
   other organizations to carry data from the PSAP to responders are
   designed to carry all additional data supplied in the call that
   conform to this document, even if the PSAP does not fetch or
   interpret the data.  This allows responders to get the data even if
   the PSAP does not.

3.3.8.  Choosing between defining a new type of block or new type of
        device/service specific additional data

   For devices that have device or service specific data, there are two
   choices to carry it.  A new block can be defined, or the device/
   service specific additional data URL the DeviceInfo block can be used
   and a new type for it defined .  The data passed would likely be the
   same in both cases.  Considerations for choosing which mechanism to
   register under include:

   Applicability:  Information which will be carried by many kinds of
      devices or services are more appropriately defined as separate
      blocks.

   Privacy:  Information which may contain private data may be better
      sent in the DeviceInfo block, rather than a new block so that
      implementations are not tempted to send the data by value, and
      thus having more exposure to the data than forcing the data to be
      retrieved via the URL in DeviceInfo.

   Size:  Information which may be very may be better sent in the
      DeviceInfo block, rather than a new block so that implementations

Internet-Draft            Additional Call Data             February 2014


      are not tempted to send the data by value.  Conversely, data which
      is small may best be sent in a separate block so that it can be
      sent by value

   Availability of a server:  Providing the data via the device block
      requires a server be made available to retrieve the data.
      Providing the data via new block allows it to be sent by value
      (CID).

3.4.  Owner/Subscriber Information

   This block describes the owner of the device (if provided by the
   device) or the subscriber information, if provided by a service
   provider.  The contact location is not necessarily the location of
   the caller or incident, but is rather the nominal contact address.
   The mime subtype is "application/EmergencyCallData.Subscriber+xml".

   In some jurisdictions some or all parts of the subscriber-specific
   information are subject to privacy constraints.  These constraints
   vary but dictate what information and be displayed and logged.  A
   general privacy indicator expressing a desire for privacy is
   provided.  The interpretation of how this is applied is left to the
   receiving jurisdiction as the custodians of the local regulatory
   requirements.

3.4.1.  Subscriber Data Privacy Indicator

   Attribute:  privacyRequested, boolean.

Internet-Draft            Additional Call Data             February 2014


   Use:  Conditional.  This attribute MUST be provided if the owner/
      subscriber information block is not empty.

   Description:  The subscriber data privacy indicator specifically
      expresses the subscriber's desire for privacy.  In some
      jurisdictions subscriber services can have a specific "Type of
      Service" which prohibits information, such as the name of the
      subscriber, from being displayed.  This attribute should be used
      to explicitly indicate whether the subscriber service includes
      such constraints.

   Reason for Need:  Some jurisdictions require subscriber privacy to be
      observed.

   How Used by Call Taker:  Where privacy is indicated the call taker
      may not have access to some aspects of the subscriber information.

3.4.2.  xCard for Subscriber's Data

   Data Element:  xCARD for Subscriber's Data

   Use:  Conditional.  Subscriber data is provided unless it is not
      available.  Some services, for example prepaid phones, non-
      initialized phones, etc., do not have information about the
      subscriber.

   XML Element:  <SubscriberData>

   Description:  Information known by the service provider or device
      about the subscriber; e.g., Name, Address, Individual Telephone
      Number, Main Telephone Number and any other data.  N, ORG (if
      appropriate), ADR, TEL, EMAIL are suggested at a minimum.  If more
      than one TEL property is provided, a parameter from the vCard
      Property Value registry MUST be specified on each TEL.

   Reason for Need:  When the caller is unable to provide information,
      this data may be used to obtain it

   How Used by Call Taker:  Obtaining critical information about the
      caller and possibly the location when it is not able to be
      obtained otherwise.

Internet-Draft            Additional Call Data             February 2014


   This section defines how to convey additional data to an emergency
   service provider.  Two different means are specified: the first uses
   the call signaling; the second uses the <provided-by> element of a
   PIDF-LO [RFC4119].

   1.  First, the ability to embed a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
       in an existing SIP header field, the Call-Info header, is
       defined.  The URI points to the additional data structure.  The
       Call-Info header is specified in Section 20.9 of [RFC3261].  This
       document adds a new compound token starting with the value
       'EmergencyCallData' for the Call-Info "purpose" parameter.  If
       the "purpose" parameter is set to a value starting with
       'EmergencyCallData', then the Call-Info header contains either an
       HTTPS URL pointing to an external resource or a CID (content
       indirection) URI that allows the data structure to be placed in
       the body of the SIP message.  The "purpose" parameter also
       indicates the kind of data (by its MIME type) that is available
       at the URI.  As the data is conveyed using a URI in the SIP
       signaling, the data itself may reside on an external resource, or
       may be contained within the body of the SIP message.  When the
       URI refers to data at an external resource, the data is said to
       be passed by reference.  When the URI refers to data contained
       within the body of the SIP message, the data is said to be passed
       by value.  A PSAP or emergency responder is able to examine the
       type of data provided and selectively inspect the data it is
       interested in, while forwarding all of it (the values or
       references) to downstream entities.  To be conveyed in a SIP
       body, additional data about a call is defined as a series of MIME
       objects.  Each block defined in this document is an XML data
       structure identified by its MIME type.  (Blocks defined by others
       may be encoded in XML or not, as identified by their MIME
       registration.)  As usual, whenever more than one MIME part is
       included in the body of a message, MIME-multipart (i.e.,
       'multipart/mixed') encloses them all.  This document defines a
       set of XML schemas and MIME types used for each block defined
       here.  When additional data is passed by value in the SIP
       signaling, each CID URL points to one block in the body.
       Multiple URIs are used within a Call-Info header field (or
       multiple Call-Info header fields) to point to multiple blocks.
       When additional data is provided by reference (in SIP signaling
       or Provided-By), each HTTPS URL references one block; the data is
       retrieved with an HTTPS GET operation, which returns one of the
       blocks as an object (the blocks defined here are returned as XML
       objects).

   2.  Second, the ability to embed additional data structures in the
       <provided-by> element of a PIDF-LO [RFC4119] is defined.  Besides
       a service provider in the call path, the access network provider



Rosen, et al.            Expires August 15, 2014               [Page 29]

Internet-Draft            Additional Call Data             February 2014


       may also have similar information that may be valuable to the
       PSAP.  The access network provider may provide location in the
       form of a PIDF-LO from a location server via a location
       configuration protocol.  The data structures described in this
       document are not specific to the location itself, but rather
       provides descriptive information having to do with the immediate
       circumstances about the provision of the location (who the access
       network is, how to contact that entity, what kind of service the
       access network provides, subscriber information, etc.).  This
       data is similar in nearly every respect to the data known by
       service providers in the path of the call.  When the access
       network provider and service provider are separate entities, the
       access network does not participate in the application layer
       signaling (and hence cannot add a Call-Info header field to the
       SIP message), but may provide location information to assist in
       locating the caller's device.  The <provided-by> element of the
       PIDF-LO is a mechanism for the access network provider to supply
       the information about the entity or organization that supplied
       this location information.  For this reason, this document
       describes a namespace per RFC 4119 for inclusion in the
       <provided-by> element of a PIDF-LO for adding information known
       to the access network provider.

   One or more blocks of data registered in the Emergency Call
   Additional Data registry, as defined in Section 9.1, may be included
   or referenced in the SIP signaling (using the Call-Info header field)
   or in the <provided-by> element of a PIDF-LO.  Every block must be
   one of the types in the registry.  Since the data of an emergency
   call may come from multiple sources, the data itself needs
   information describing the source.  Consequently, each entity adding
   additional data MUST supply the "Data Provider" block.  All other
   blocks are optional, but each entity SHOULD supply any blocks where
   it has at least some of the information in the block.

4.1.  Transmitting Blocks using the Call-Info Header

   A URI to a block MAY be inserted in a SIP request or response method
   (most often INVITE or MESSAGE) with a Call-Info header field
   containing a purpose value starting with 'EmergencyCallData' and the
   type of data available at the URI.  The type of data is denoted by
   including the root of the MIME type (not including the
   'EmergencyCallData' prefix and any suffix such as '+xml') with a '.'
   separator.  For example, when referencing a block with MIME type
   'application/EmergencyCallData.ProviderInfo+xml', the 'purpose'
   parameter is set to 'EmergencyCallData.ProviderInfo'.  An example
   "Call-Info" header field for this would be:





Rosen, et al.            Expires August 15, 2014               [Page 30]

Internet-Draft            Additional Call Data             February 2014


   Call-Info:  https://www.example.com/23sedde3;
       purpose="EmergencyCallData.ProviderInfo"

   A Call-info header with a purpose value starting with
   'EmergencyCallData' MUST only be sent on an emergency call, which can
   be ascertained by the presence of an emergency service urn in a Route
   header of a SIP message.

   If the data is provided by reference, an HTTPS URI MUST be included
   and consequently Transport Layer Security (TLS) protection is applied
   for protecting the retrieval of the information.

   The data may also be supplied by value in a SIP message.  In this
   case, Content Indirection (CID) [RFC2392] is used, with the CID URL
   referencing the MIME body part.

   More than one Call-Info header with a purpose value starting with
   'EmergencyCallData' can be expected, but at least one MUST be
   provided.  The device MUST provide one if it knows no service
   provider is in the path of the call.  The device MAY insert one if it
   uses a service provider.  Any service provider in the path of the
   call MUST insert its own.  For example, a device, a telematics
   service provider in the call path, as well as the mobile carrier
   handling the call will each provide one.  There may be circumstances
   where there is a service provider who is unaware that the call is an
   emergency call and cannot reasonably be expected to determine that it
   is an emergency call.  In that case, that service provider is not
   expected to provide EmergencyCallData.

4.2.  Transmitting Blocks by Reference using the Provided-By Element

   The 'EmergencyCallDataReference' element is used to transmit an
   additional data block by reference within a 'Provided-By' element of
   a PIDF-LO.  The 'EmergencyCallDataReference' element has two
   attributes: 'ref' to specify the URL, and 'purpose' to indicate the
   type of data block referenced.  The value of 'ref' is an HTTPS URL
   that resolves to a data structure with information about the call.
   The value of 'purpose' is the same as used in a 'Call-Info' header
   field (as specified in Section 4.1).

   For example, to reference a block with MIME type 'application/
   EmergencyCallData.ProviderInfo+xml', the 'purpose' parameter is set
   to 'EmergencyCallData.ProviderInfo'.  An example
   'EmergencyCallDataReference' element for this would be:

      <EmergencyCallDataReference ref="https://www.example.com/23sedde3"
      purpose="EmergencyCallData.ProviderInfo"/>

Internet-Draft            Additional Call Data             February 2014


4.3.  Transmitting Blocks by Value using the Provided-By Element

   It is RECOMMENDED that access networks supply the data specified in
   this document by reference, but they MAY provide the data by value.

   The 'EmergencyCallDataValue' element is used to transmit an
   additional data block by value within a 'Provided-By' element of a
   PIDF-LO.  The 'EmergencyCallDataValue' element has one attribute:
   'purpose' to indicate the type of data block contained.  The value of
   'purpose' is the same as used in a 'Call-Info' header field (as
   specified in Section 4.1, and in Section 4.1).  The same XML
   structure as would be contained in the corresponding MIME type body
   part is placed inside the 'EmergencyCallDataValue' element.

   For example:


         <provided-by
           xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:EmergencyCallData">
           <EmergencyCallData>
             <byRef purpose="EmergencyCallData.ServiceInfo"
                    ref="https://example.com/ref2"/>
             <sub:EmergencyCallData.Comment
               xmlns:sub="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:EmergencyCallData.Comment">
               <sub:Comment xml:lang="en">This is an example text.
             </sub:Comment>
             </sub:EmergencyCallData.Comment>
           </EmergencyCallData>
           <EmergencyCallDataValue
             purpose="EmergencyCallData.ProviderInfo">
             <ProviderID>Test</ProviderID>
             <ProviderIDSeries>NENA</ProviderIDSeries>
             <TypeOfProviderID>Access Infrastructure Provider
           </TypeOfProviderID>
             <ContactURI>sip:15555550987@burf.example.com;user=phone
             </ContactURI>
           </EmergencyCallDataValue>
         </provided-by>


                       Example Provided-By by Value.

4.4.  The Content-Disposition Parameter

   RFC 5621 [RFC5621] discusses the handling of message bodies in SIP.
   It updates and clarifies handling originally defined in RFC 3261
   [RFC3261] based on implementation experience.  While RFC 3261 did not
   mandate support for 'multipart' message bodies, 'multipart/mixed'



Rosen, et al.            Expires August 15, 2014               [Page 32]

Internet-Draft            Additional Call Data             February 2014


   MIME bodies are used by many extensions (including this document)
   today.  For example, adding a PIDF-LO, SDP, and additional data in
   body of a SIP message requires a 'multipart' message body.

   RFC 3204 [RFC3204] and RFC 3459 [RFC3459] define the 'handling'
   parameter for the Content-Disposition header field.  These RFCs
   describe how a UAS reacts if it receives a message body whose content
   type or disposition type it does not understand.  If the 'handling'
   parameter has the value "optional", the UAS ignores the message body.
   If the 'handling' parameter has the value "required", the UAS returns
   a 415 (Unsupported Media Type) response.  The 'by-reference'
   disposition type allows a SIP message to contain a reference to the
   body part, and the SIP UA processes the body part according to the
   reference.  This is the case for the Call-info header containing a
   Content Indirection (CID) URL.

   As an example, a SIP message indicates the Content-Disposition
   parameter in the body of the SIP message as shown in Figure 10.


         Content-Type: application/sdp

         ...Omit Content-Disposition here; defaults are ok
         ...SDP goes in here

         --boundary1

         Content-Type: application/pidf+xml
         Content-ID: <target123@atlanta.example.com>
         Content-Disposition: by-reference;handling=optional

         ...PIDF-LO goes in here

         --boundary1--

         Content-Type: application/EmergencyCallData.ProviderInfo+xml
         Content-ID: <1234567890@atlanta.example.com>
         Content-Disposition: by-reference; handling=optional

         ...Data provider information data goes in here

         --boundary1--

   is included in the call setup message only indirectly via the use of

   the location reference.  The PSAP has to retrieve it via a separate
   look-up step.  Since the access network provider and the VoIP service
   provider are two independent entities in this scenario, the access
   network operator is not involved in application layer exchanges; the
   SIP INVITE transits the access network transparently, as illustrated
   in step #1.  No change to the SIP INVITE is applied.

   When the VoIP service provider receives the message and determines
   based on the Service URN that the incoming request is an emergency
   call.  It performs the typical emergency services related tasks,
   including location-based routing, and adds additional data, namely
   service and subscriber information, to the outgoing message.  For the
   example we assume a VoIP service provider that deploys a back-to-back
   user agent allowing additional data to be included in the body of the
   SIP message (rather than per reference in the header), which allows
   us to illustrate the use of multiple data provider info blocks.  The
   resulting message is shown in Figure 13.

7.  Security Considerations

Internet-Draft            Additional Call Data             February 2014


   The information in this data structure will usually be considered
   private.  HTTPS is specified to require the provider of the
   information to validate the credentials of the requester.  While the
   creation of a public key infrastructure (PKI) that has global scope
   may be difficult, the alternatives to creating devices and services
   that can provide critical information securely are more daunting.
   The provider may enforce any policy it wishes to use, but PSAPs and
   responder agencies should deploy a PKI so that providers of
   additional data can check the certificate of the client and decide
   the appropriate policy to enforce based on that certificate.

   Ideally, the PSAP and emergency responders will be given credentials
   signed by an authority trusted by the data provider.  In most
   circumstances, nationally recognized credentials would be sufficient,
   and if the emergency services arranges a PKI, data providers could be
   provisioned with the root CA public key for a given nation.  Some
   nations are developing a PKI for this, and related, purposes.  Since
   calls could be made from devices where the device and/or the service
   provider(s) are not local to the emergency authorities, globally
   recognized credentials are useful.  This might be accomplished by
   extending the notion of the "forest guide" described in [RFC5222] to
   allow the forest guide to provide the credential of the PKI root for
   areas that it has coverage information for, but standards for such a
   mechanism are not yet available.  In its absence, the data provider
   will need to obtain the root CA credentials for any areas it is
   willing to provide additional data by out of band means.  With the
   credential of the root CA for a national emergency services PKI, the
   data provider server can validate the credentials of an entity
   requesting additional data by reference.

   The data provider also needs a credential that can be verified by the
   emergency services to know that it is receiving data from the right
   server.  The emergency authorities could provide credentials,
   distinguishable from credentials it provides to emergency responders
   and PSAPs, which could be used to validate data providers.  Such
   credentials would have to be acceptable to any PSAP or responder that
   could receive a call with additional data supplied by that provider.
   This would be extensible to global credential validation using the
   forest guide as above.  In the absence of such credentials, the
   emergency authorities could maintain a list of local data providers'
   credentials provided to it out of band.  At a minimum, the emergency
   authorities could obtain a credential from the DNS entry of the
   domain in the Additional Data URI to at least validate that the
   server is known to the domain providing the URI.

   Data provided by devices by reference have similar credential
   validation issues to service providers, and the solutions are the
   same.

8.  Privacy Considerations

   This document enables functionality for conveying additional
   information about the caller to the callee.  Some of this information
   is personal data and therefore privacy concerns arise.  An explicit
   privacy indicator for information directly relating to the callers
   identity is defined and use is mandatory.  However, observance of
   this request for privacy and what information it relates to is
   controlled by the destination jurisdiction.

   There are a number of privacy concerns with regular real-time
   communication services that are also applicable to emergency calling.
   Data protection regulation world-wide has, however, decided to create
   exceptions for emergency services since the drawbacks of disclosing
   personal data in comparison to the benefit for the emergency caller
   are often towards the latter.  Hence, the data protection rights of
   individuals are often waived for emergency situations.  There are,
   however, still various countries that offer some degree of anonymity
   for the caller towards PSAP call takers.

   The functionality defined in this document, however, far exceeds the
   amount of information sharing found in the Plain old telephone system
   (POTS).  For this reason there are additional privacy threats to
   consider, which are described in more detail in [RFC6973].

   Stored Data Compromise:  First, there is an increased risk of stored
      data compromise since additional data is collected and stored in
      databases.  Without adequate measures to secure stored data from
      unauthorized or inappropriate access at access network operators,
      service providers, end devices, as well as PSAPs individuals are
      exposed to potential financial, reputational, or physical harm.

   Misattribution:  If the personal data collected and conveyed is
      incorrect or inaccurate then this may lead to misattribution.
      Misattribution occurs when data or communications related to one
      individual are attributed to another.

   Identification:  By the nature of the additional data and its
      capability to provide much richer information about the caller,
      the call, and the location the calling party is identified in a
      much better way.  Some users may feel uncomfortable with this
      degree of information sharing even in emergency services
      situations.

   Secondary Use:  Furthermore, there is the risk of secondary use.
      Secondary use is the use of collected information about an
      individual without the individual's consent for a purpose
      different from that for which the information was collected.  The



Rosen, et al.            Expires August 15, 2014               [Page 54]

Internet-Draft            Additional Call Data             February 2014


      stated purpose of the additional data is for emergency services
      purposes but theoretically the same information could be used for
      any other call as well.  Additionally, parties involved in the
      emergency call may retain the obtained information and may re-use
      it for other, non-emergency services purposes.

   Disclosure:  When the data defined in this document is not properly
      security (while in transit with traditional communication security
      techniques, and while at rest using access control mechanisms)
      there is the risk of disclosure, which is the revelation of
      information about an individual that affects the way others judge
      the individual.

   To mitigate these privacy risks the following countermeasures can be
   taken.

   In regions where callers can elect to suppress certain personally
   identifying information, the network or PSAP functionality can
   inspect privacy flags within the SIP headers to determine what
   information may be passed, stored, or displayed to comply with local
   policy or law.  RFC 3325 [RFC3325] defines the "id" priv-value token.
   The presence of this privacy type in a Privacy header field indicates
   that the user would like the network asserted identity to be kept
   private with respect to SIP entities outside the trust domain with
   which the user authenticated, including the PSAP.

   This document defines various data structures that constitutes
   personal data.  Local regulations may govern what data must be
   provided in emergency calls, but in general, the emergency call
   system is often aided by the kinds of information described in this
   document.  There is a tradeoff between the privacy considerations and
   the utility of the data.  For adequate protection this specification
   requires all data exchanges to be secured via communication security
   techniques (namely TLS) against eavesdropping and inception.
   Furthermore, security safeguards are required to prevent unauthorized
   access to data at rest.  Various security incidents over the last 10
   years have shown data breaches are not not uncommon and are often
   caused by lack of proper access control frameworks, software bugs
   (buffer overflows), or missing input parsing (SQL injection attacks).
   The risks of data breaches is increased with the obligation for
   emergency services to retain emergency call related data for extended
   periods, e.g., several years are the norm.

   Finally, it is also worth to highlight the nature of the SIP
   communication architecture, which introduces additional complications
   for privacy.  Some forms of data can be sent by value in the SIP
   signaling or by value (URL in SIP signaling).  When data is sent by
   value, all intermediaries have access to the data.  As such, these

Internet-Draft            Additional Call Data             February 2014


   intermediaries may also introduce additional privacy risk.
   Therefore, in situations where the conveyed information raises
   privacy concerns and intermediaries are involved transmitting a
   reference is more appropriate (assuming proper access control
   policies are available for distinguishing the different entities
   dereferencing the reference).  Without access control policies any
   party in possession of the reference is able to resolve the reference
   and to obtain the data, including intermediaries.

9.  IANA Considerations

9.1.  Registry creation

   This document creates a new registry called 'Emergency Call
   Additional Data'.  The following sub-registries are created for this
   registry.

9.1.1.  Provider ID Series Registry

   This document creates a new sub-registry called 'Additional Call Data
   Provider ID Series'.  As defined in [RFC5226], this registry operates
   under "Expert Review" rules.  The expert should determine that the
   entity requesting a new value is a legitimate issuer of service
   provider IDs suitable for use in Additional Call Data.

   The content of this registry includes:

   Name:  The identifier which will be used in the ProviderIDSeries
      element

   Source:  The full name of the organization issuing the identifiers

   URL:  A URL to the organization for further information

   The initial set of values is listed in Figure 21.
