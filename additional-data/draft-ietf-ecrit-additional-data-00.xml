      <t>When an emergency call is sent to a PSAP, the device that sends it, as well as any service
        provider in the path of the call may have information about the call which the PSAP may be
        able to use. This document describes an XML data structure that contains this kind of
        information in a standardized form. A URI that points to the structure can be included in
        the SIP signaling with the call. </t>

    <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>When an emergency call is sent to a PSAP, there is a rich set of data in the headers with
        the call, but the device, as well as any other service provider in the path may have even
        more information that would be useful to a PSAP. This information may include the identity
        and contact information of the service provider, subscriber identity and contact
        information, the type of service the service provider provides, what kind of device the user
        has, etc. Some kinds of devices or services have device or service dependent data. For
        example, a car telematics system or service may have crash information. A medical monitoring
        device may have sensor data. While the details of the information may vary by device or
        service, there needs to be a common way to send such data to a PSAP. </t>
      <t> For the call takers this will enable more intelligent decision making and therefore better
        response in case of an emergency. A pre-requisite is to offer the technical capabilities to
        let call takers to gain access to this information stored elsewhere (granted that they have
        authorization to access it). </t>
      <t> This document focuses on the data that can be obtained about a call and an existing SIP
        header field, the Call-Info header, is used for this purpose by defining a new token, namely
        'emergencyCallData' carried in the "purpose" parameter. If the "purpose" parameter set to
        'emergencyCallData' then the Call-Info contains a HTTPS URL that points to an XML data
        structure with information about the call. The initial XML data structure was defined by a
        working group within the National Emergency Number Association (NENA) and is included in
        this document.</t>
      <t>The data structure contains an element which itself is a URI that has device or service
        dependent data. Thus the common Additional Data about a Call defined by this document
        contains a 'hook', in the form of a URI for a device or service dependent data structure.</t>

    <section title="Additional Data about a Call">
      <t>The Additional Data about a Call is information specific to a call known by the device that
        sends it or a service provider in the path of a call. The Additional Data about a Call is an
        XML data structure. An HTTPS URI to that structure may be inserted in a SIP INVITE or
        MESSAGE transaction with a Call-Info header containing a purpose of "emergenyCallData". The
        data, which must conform to the schema in <xref target="schema"/> may be retrieved with an
        HTTPS Get. HTTPS MUST be used. </t>
      <t> More than one Call-Info header with an emergencyCallData purpose can be expected. The
        device may insert one, and any intermediary service provider may insert its own. When there
        are multiple intermediaries each intermediary may each insert one. For example, a device may
        provide one, a telematics service provider may provide one and the mobile carrier handling
        the call may provide one. </t>
