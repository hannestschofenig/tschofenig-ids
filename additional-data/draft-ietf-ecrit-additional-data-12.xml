			<t>When an emergency call is sent to a Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP), 
      the device that sends it, as well as any application service
      provider in the path of the call, or access network provider through which the call 
      originated may have information about the call, the caller or the location which the PSAP may be
      able to use. This document describes data structures and a mechanism to convey such data to the PSAP.
      The mechanism uses a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), which may point to either an external resource or an object in the body of the SIP message.
      The mechanism thus allows the data to be passed by reference (when the URI points to an external resource) or by value (when it points into the body of the message).  This follows the tradition of prior 
	  emergency services standardization work where data can be conveyed by value within the call signaling 
	  (i.e., in body of the SIP message) and also by reference.</t>

		<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">

			<t>When an IP-based emergency call is initiated a rich set of data from multiple data sources is conveyed to the  
           Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP). This data includes information about the calling party 
		   identity, the multimedia capabilities of the device, the emergency service number, location information, and meta-data about the sources of the data. 
		   The device, the access network provider, and any service 
		   provider in the call path may have even more information useful for a PSAP. This document extends the basic set of
		   data communicated with an IP-based emergency call, as described in <xref target="RFC6443"/> and <xref target="RFC6881"/>, in order 
		   to carry additional data which may be useful to an entity or call taker handling the call.  This data is "additional" to the basic 
		   information found in the emergency call signaling used.
			</t>

			<t>In general, there are three categories of data communicated in an emergency call:

				<list style="hanging"> 

					<t hangText="Data Associated with a Location:">Location data is conveyed in the Presence Information Data Format 
					Location Object (PIDF-LO) data structure originally defined in RFC 4119 <xref target="RFC4119"/> and extended by RFC 5139 <xref target="RFC5139"/> and RFC 6848 <xref target="RFC6848"/> (for civic location information), RFC 5491 <xref target="RFC5491"/> and RFC 5962 <xref target="RFC5962"/> (for geodetic location information), and <xref target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-relative-location"/> (for relative location). There may be 
					data that is specific to the location not available in the location data structure itself, such as floor plans, 
					tenant and building owner contact data, heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) status, etc.</t>

					<t hangText="Data Associated with a Call:">While information is carried in the call setup procedure itself 
					(as part of the SIP headers as well as in the body of the SIP message), there is additional data known by the 
					device making the call, and the service provider along the path of the call.  This information may include the service provider contact information, 
					subscriber identity and contact
                    information, the type of service the service provider and the access network provider offer, what kind of device is being used, etc. Some data is device or 
					service dependent data. For example, a car telematics system may have crash information. A medical monitoring
                    device may have sensor data.</t>

					<t hangText="Data Associated with a Caller:">This is personal data about a caller, such as medical information and 
					emergency contact data.</t>
				</list> 
			</t>

			<t>This document only defines data structures relevant to data associated with the call but defines extension points for other data to be added via other specifications.</t>

			<t>For interoperability, there needs to be a common way for the
    information conveyed to a PSAP to be encoded and identified.
    Identification allows emergency services authorities to know
    during call processing which types of data are present and to
    determine if they wish to access it.  A common encoding allows
    the data to be accessed.</t>

			<t>This document defines the data structures 
			and a way to communicate the information in several ways. Although current standardization efforts around IP-based emergency 
			services are focused on the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and HTTP the data structures in XML format described in this document 
            are usable for other communication systems as well. In <xref target="data-structures"/> the data structures are defined and the SIP/HTTP transport 
			components are defined in <xref target="transport"/> to offer a clear separation between the two.</t>


			<t>More technically, the data structure described in this document is represented as one or more "blocks" of information. 

			Each of the blocks is an XML structure with an associated Multipurpose Internet Mail
    Extensions (MIME) type for encapsulation, and an extensible set of these types constitute 
			the data set. A registry is defined to list the block types that may be included.  
			</t>
			<!-- 
			<t>Devices or services may have data useful to PSAPs and emergency responders that is specific to the type of device or service providing the data.  An example is telematics data available from vehicles equipped with sensors and mechanisms to provide the sensor data (for example, the VEDS data set).  The mechanism described in this document can be used to provide such data by defining a MIME type and including a reference to the data in the Call-Info header.  PSAPS and emergency responders have to be prepared in advance to handle such data, and may or may not choose to accept it.  To control the types of data a PSAP or responder may encounter using this mechanism, a registry of data sets is created by this document.  The registry allows the PSAP, responder, or entity processing the 
call to identify in advance the types of data it is prepared to 
accept, and fetch or access only those types.</t>

		<!-- ******************************************************************************* -->

		<section title="Terminology">
			<t> The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD
        NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
        described in <xref target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>
			<!-- 			<t>The term "Service Provider" is used throughout this document as a service entity in the path of an emergency call (such as a carrier or a relay service) or the access infrastructure provider who may provide location.</t> -->

			<t>This document also uses terminology from <xref target="RFC5012"/>. 
   We use the term service provider to refer to an Application Service Provider (ASP). A Voice Service Provider (VSP) is a special type of ASP. With the term "Access Network Provider" we refer to the Internet
   Access Provider (IAP) and the Internet Service Provider (ISP) without further distinguishing these two entities, since the difference between the two is not relevant for this document. Note that the roles of ASP and access network provider may be provided by a single company.</t>

			<t>In the data block definitions, see <xref target="data-structures"/>, the values for the "Use:" label are specified as one of:
				<list style="hanging">
					<t hangText="'Required':"> means they MUST be present in the data structure.</t>
					<t hangText="'Conditional':"> means they MUST be present if the specified condition(s) is met. 
					   They MAY be present if the condition(s) is not met.</t>
					<t hangText="'Optional':"> means they MAY be present.</t>
				</list>
			</t>

			<t>vCard is a data format for representing and
   exchanging a variety of information about individuals and other
   entities. For applications that use XML the format defined in vCard is not immediately applicable. For this purpose an XML-based encoding of the information elements defined in the vCard specification has been defined and the name of that specification is xCard. Since the term vCard is more familiar to most readers we use the term xCard and vCard interchangeable but it would be accurate to use the term vCard only.</t> 

		</section>

		<!-- ******************************************************************************* -->
		<section anchor="data-structures" title="Data Structures">
			<t>This section defines the following five data structures, each as a data block. For each block we define the MIME type, and the XML data structure. The five data structures are: 
				<list style="hanging">
					<t hangText="'Data Provider':"> This block supplies name and contact information for the entity that created the data. <xref target="data-provider"/> provides the details. </t>
					<t hangText="'Service Information':">  This block supplies information about the service. The description can be found in <xref target="service-information"/>.</t>
					<t hangText="'Device Information':">  This block supplies information about the device placing the call. Device information can be found in <xref target="device-information"/>.</t>
					<t hangText="'Owner/Subscriber':">  This block supplies information about the owner of the device or about the subscriber. Details can be found in <xref target="owner-subscriber"/>.</t>
					<t hangText="'Comment':">  This block provides a way to supply free form human readable text to the PSAP or emergency responders. This simple structure is defined in <xref target="comment"/>.</t>
				</list>
			</t>

			<t>Note that the xCard format is re-used in some of the data structures to provide contact information. In an xCard there is no way to specify a "main" telephone number. These numbers are useful to emergency responders who are called to a large enterprise.  This document adds a new property value to the "tel" property of the TYPE parameter called "main". It can be used in any xCard in additional data.</t>

			<section anchor="data-provider" title="Data Provider Information">
				<t>This block is intended to be provided by any service provider in the
   path of the call or the access network provider.  It includes
   identification and contact information.  This block SHOULD be
   provided by every service provider in the call path, and by the
   access network provider. Devices MAY use this block to provide
   identifying information. The MIME subtype is "application/emergencyCall.ProviderInfo+xml".
   An access network provider SHOULD provide this block either by value or by reference in 
   the Provided-By section of a PIDF-LO</t>

      For devices that have device or service specific data, there are two choices to carry it.  A new block can be defined, or the device/service specific additional data URL the DevInfo block can be used and a new type for it defined .  The data passed would likely be the same in both cases.  Considerations for choosing which mechanism to register under include:
						<list style="hanging">
							<t hangText="Applicability:">Information which will be carried by many kinds of devices or services are more appropriately defined as separate blocks.</t>
							<t hangText="Privacy:">Information which may contain private data may be better sent in the DevInfo block, rather than a new block so that implementations are not tempted to send the data by value, and thus having more exposure to the data than forcing the data to be retrieved via the URL in DevInfo.</t>
							<t hangText="Size:">Information which may be very may be better sent in the DevInfo block, rather than a new block so that implementations are not tempted to send the data by value.  Conversely, data which is small may best be sent in a separate block so that it can be sent by value</t>
							<t hangText="Availability of a server:">Providing the data via the device block requires a server be made available to retrieve the data.  Providing the data via new block allows it to be sent by value (CID).</t>

		<section anchor="transport" title="Transport">

			<t>This section defines how to convey additional data to an
     emergency service provider.  Two different means are
     specified: the first uses the call signaling; the second uses
     the &lt;provided-by&gt; element of a PIDF-LO <xref target="RFC4119"/>.

				<list style="numbers">
					<t>
			First, the ability to embed a Uniform Resource Identifier
        (URI) in an existing SIP header field, the Call-Info
        header, is defined.  The URI points to the additional data
        structure.  The Call-Info header is specified in Section
        20.9 of <xref target="RFC3261"/>.  This document adds a new compound token starting with
        the value 'emergencyCallData' for the Call-Info "purpose"
        parameter. If the 
			 "purpose" parameter is set to a value starting with 'emergencyCallData', then the Call-Info header contains either an HTTPS URL pointing to an external resource or a CID (content indirection) URI that allows the data structure to be placed 
			 in the body of the SIP message. The "purpose" parameter also indicates the kind of data (by its MIME type) that is available at the URI.

			 As the data is conveyed using a URI in the SIP signaling, the data itself may reside on an external resource, or may be
   contained within the body of the SIP message.  When the URI refers to data at an external resource, the data is said to be passed by reference.  
   When the URI refers to data contained within the body of the SIP message, the data is said to be passed by value. A PSAP or emergency responder is able to examine the type of data provided and selectively inspect the data it is interested in, while forwarding all of it (the values or references) to downstream entities.

			 To be conveyed in a SIP body, additional data about a call is defined as a series of MIME objects.  Each block defined in this document is an XML data 
   structure identified by its MIME type.  (Blocks defined by others may be encoded in XML or not, as identified by their MIME registration.)  As usual, whenever more than one MIME part is included in the 
body of a message, MIME-multipart (i.e., 'multipart/mixed') encloses 
them all.  This document defines a set of XML schemas and MIME types used for each 
block defined here.  When additional data is passed by value in the SIP signaling, each CID URL points to one block in the body.  Multiple URIs are used within a Call-Info header field (or multiple Call-Info header fields) to point to multiple blocks.  When additional data is provided by reference (in SIP signaling or Provided-By), each HTTPS URL references one block; the data is retrieved with an HTTPS GET operation, which returns one of the blocks as an object (the blocks defined here are returned as XML objects).  
					</t>

					<t>Second, the ability to embed additional data structures in the &lt;provided-by&gt; element of a PIDF-LO <xref target="RFC4119"/> is defined. Besides a service provider in the call path, the access network provider may also have similar information
			that may be valuable to the PSAP. The access network provider may provide location in the form of 
			a PIDF-LO  from a location server via a location configuration protocol. The data structures described in this document are not specific to the location itself, but rather provides descriptive 
			information having to do with the immediate circumstances about the provision of the location (who the access network is, 
			how to contact that entity, what kind of service the access network provides, subscriber information, etc.).  This data is 
			similar in nearly every respect to the data known by service providers in the path of the call.  When the access network 
			provider and service provider are separate entities, the access network does not participate in the application layer signaling 
			(and hence cannot add a Call-Info header field to the SIP message), but may provide location information to assist in 
			locating the caller's device.  The &lt;provided-by&gt; element of the PIDF-LO is a mechanism for the access network provider to supply the 
			information about the entity or organization that supplied this location information. For this reason, this document describes 
			a namespace per RFC 4119 for inclusion in the &lt;provided-by&gt; element of a PIDF-LO for adding information known 
			to the access network provider.</t>
				</list> 
			</t>


			<!-- 
			<t>The subsequent sections specify how to transmit blocks of additional data.</t>
			
			<t>Blocks can be sent by value (the data in the SIP body or PIDF-LO) or by reference (the data is retrieved via HTTPS from an external server).  Data may be provided by the device and/or one or more service providers.  For example, the device may provide device specific information by value, a telematics service provider may provide its contact data and data derived from the sensor data (e.g., injury prediction) by reference, and an access network provider may provide contact information by value, all in the same SIP INVITE.</t>

			<t>The access network provider may supply additional data as well, by including the data within a Provided-By element of a PDIF-LO it returns for emergency use (e.g., if requested with a HELD "responseTime" attribute of "emergencyRouting" or "emergencyDispatch" <xref target="RFC5985"/>). Access network providers are expected to normally supply such information by reference (by including an HTTPS URI within the Provided-By element). This document defines a namespace and adds the namespace to the "provided-by" registry defined by PIDF-LO <xref target="RFC4119"/>.</t>

			
		<section title="Transmitting Blocks of Additional Data" anchor="transmitting_blocks">
--> 
			<t>One or more blocks of data registered in the Emergency Call Additional Data registry, as defined in 
				<xref target="RegCreate"/>, may be included or referenced in the SIP signaling (using the Call-Info header field) or in the &lt;provided-by&gt; element
     of a PIDF-LO. Every block must be one of the types in the registry. Since the data of an emergency call may come from multiple sources, the data itself needs information describing the source. Consequently, each entity adding additional data MUST supply the "Data Provider" block.  All other blocks are optional, but each entity SHOULD supply any blocks where it has at least some of the information in the block.</t>




			<section title="Transmitting Blocks using the Call-Info Header" anchor="using-call-info">
				<t>A URI to
   a block MAY be inserted in a SIP request or response method (most often INVITE or MESSAGE)
   with a Call-Info header field containing a purpose value starting with 'emergencyCallData' and the type of data available at the URI.  The type of data is denoted by including the root of the MIME type (not including the 'emergencyCall' prefix and any suffix such as '+xml') with a '.' separator.  For example, when referencing a block with MIME type 
'application/emergencyCall.ProviderInfo+xml', the 'purpose' parameter 
is set to 'emergencyCallData.ProviderInfo'.  An example "Call-Info" 
header field for this would be:
				</t>

				<t>
					<list style="hanging" hangIndent="4">
						<t hangText="Call-Info:">https://www.example.com/23sedde3; purpose="emergencyCallData.ProviderInfo"
						</t>
					</list>
				</t>

				<t>
   A Call-info header with a purpose value starting with 'emergencyCallData' MUST only be sent on an emergency
        call, which can be ascertained by the presence of an emergency service urn in a Route header
        of a SIP message. 
				</t>

				<t>
    If the data is provided by reference, an 
   HTTPS URI MUST be included and consequently
   Transport Layer Security (TLS) protection is applied for protecting the retrieval of the information.</t>

				<t>The data may also be supplied by value in a SIP message.
   In this case, Content Indirection (CID) <xref target="RFC2392"/> is used, with the CID URL referencing the MIME body part.
				</t>

				<t> More than one Call-Info header with a purpose value starting with 'emergencyCallData' can be expected, but at least one MUST be provided. 
The device MUST provide one if it knows no service provider is in the path of the call.  The
        device MAY insert one if it uses a service provider. Any service provider in the path of the call MUST insert its own. For example, a device, a telematics service provider in the call path, as well as the mobile carrier handling
        the call will each provide one.  There may be circumstances where there is a service provider who is unaware that the call is an emergency call and cannot reasonably be expected to determine that it is an emergency call.  In that case, that service provider is not expected to provide emergencyCallData.

			<section title="Transmitting Blocks by Reference using the Provided-By Element">
				<t>
    The 'emergencyCallDataReference' element is used to transmit an additional data block by reference within a 'Provided-By' element of a PIDF-LO.  The 'emergencyCallDataReference' element has two attributes: 'ref' to specify the URL, and 'purpose' to indicate the type of data block referenced.  The value of 'ref' is an HTTPS URL that resolves to a data structure with information about the call.  The value of 'purpose' is the same as used in a 'Call-Info' header field (as specified in <xref target="using-call-info"/>).
				</t>
				<t>
    For example, to reference a block with MIME type 
'application/emergencyCall.ProviderInfo+xml', the 'purpose' parameter 
is set to 'emergencyCallData.ProviderInfo'.  An example 'emergencyCallDataReference' element for this would be: 
				</t>
				<t>
					<list>
						<t>
        &lt;emergencyCallDataReference ref="https://www.example.com/23sedde3" purpose="emergencyCallData.ProviderInfo"/&gt;
						</t>
					</list>
				</t>
			</section>

			<section title="Transmitting Blocks by Value using the Provided-By Element">
				<t>
    It is RECOMMENDED that access networks supply the data specified in this document by reference, but they MAY provide the data by value.
				</t>
				<t>
    The 'emergencyCallDataValue' element is used to transmit an additional data block by value within a 'Provided-By' element of a PIDF-LO.  The 'emergencyCallDataValue' element has one attribute: 'purpose' to indicate the type of data block contained.  The value of 'purpose' is the same as used in a 'Call-Info' header field (as specified in <xref target="using-call-info"/>, and in <xref target="using-call-info"/>).  The same XML structure as would be contained in the corresponding MIME type body part is placed inside the 'emergencyCallDataValue' element.

     <section title="The Content-Disposition Parameter">
	 <t>RFC 5621 <xref target="RFC5621"/> discusses the handling of message bodies in SIP.
It updates and clarifies handling originally defined in RFC 3261 <xref target="RFC3261"/> based on implementation experience.
While RFC 3261 did not mandate support for 'multipart' message bodies 'multipart/mixed' MIME bodies are, however, used by many extensions (including additional data) today. For example, adding a PIDF-LO, SDP, and additional data in body of a SIP message requires a 'multipart' message body.</t>

<t>RFC 3204 <xref target="RFC3204"/> and RFC 3459 <xref target="RFC3459"/> define the 'handling' parameter for the Content-Disposition header field. 
These RFCs describe how a UAS reacts if it receives a message body whose content type or disposition type it does not understand. 
If the 'handling' parameter has the value "optional", the UAS ignores the message body. If the 'handling' parameter has the value "required", the UAS returns a 415 (Unsupported Media Type) response. The 'by-reference' disposition type allows a SIP message to contain a reference to the body part, and the SIP UA processes the body part according to the reference. This is the case for the Call-info header containing a Content Indirection (CID) URL.
</t>

<t>As an example, a SIP message indicates the Content-Disposition parameter in the body of the SIP message as shown in <xref target="content-disposition-example"/>.

		<section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">

			<t>The information in this data structure will usually be considered private. HTTPS is
        specified to require the provider of the information to validate the credentials of the
        requester. While the creation of a PKI that has global scope may be difficult, the
        alternatives to creating devices and services that can provide critical information securely
        are more daunting.  The provider may enforce any policy it wishes to use, but PSAPs and responder agencies should deploy a PKI so that providers of additional data can check the certificate of the client and decide the appropriate policy to enforce based on that certificate.</t>

			<t>Ideally, the PSAP and emergency responders will be given credentials signed by an authority trusted by the data provider.  In most circumstances, nationally recognized credentials would be sufficient, and if the emergency services arranges a PKI, data providers could be provisioned with the root CA public key for a given nation.  Some nations are developing a PKI for this, and related, purposes.  Since calls could be made from devices where the device and/or the service provider(s) are not local to the emergency authorities, globally recognized credentials are useful.  This might be accomplished by extending the notion of the "forest guide" described in <xref target="RFC5222"/> to allow the forest guide to provide the credential of the PKI root for areas that it has coverage information for, but standards for such a mechanism are not yet available.  In its absence, the data provider will need to obtain the root CA credentials for any areas it is willing to provide additional data by out of band means. With the credential of the root CA for a national emergency services PKI, the data provider server can validate the credentials of an entity requesting additional data by reference.</t>
			<t>The data provider also needs a credential that can be verified by the emergency services to know that it is receiving data from the right server.  The emergency authorities could provide credentials, distinguishable from credentials it provides to emergency responders and PSAPs, which could be used to validate data providers.  Such credentials would have to be acceptable to any PSAP or responder that could receive a call with additional data supplied by that provider.  This would be extensible to global credential validation using the forest guide as above.  In the absence of such credentials, the emergency authorities could maintain a list of local data providers' credentials provided to it out of band.  At a minimum, the emergency authorities could obtain a credential from the DNS entry of the domain in the Additional Data URI to at least validate that the server is known to the domain providing the URI.</t>
			<t>Data provided by devices by reference have similar credential validation issues to service providers, and the solutions are the same.</t>

		<section anchor="privacy" title="Privacy Considerations"> 

			<t>This document enables functionality for conveying additional information 
			about the caller to the callee.
		   Some of this information is personal data and therefore privacy concerns arise. 
		   An explicit privacy indicator for information directly relating to the callers 
		   identity is defined and use is mandatory. However, observance of this request 
		   for privacy and what information it relates to is controlled by the destination
		   jurisdiction.</t>
		   
		   <t>There are a number of privacy concerns with regular real-time communication 
		   services that are also applicable to emergency calling. Data protection 
		   regulation world-wide has, however, decided to create exceptions for 
		   emergency services since the drawbacks of disclosing personal data in 
		   comparison to the benefit for the emergency caller are often towards the 
		   latter. Hence, the data protection rights of individuals are often waived for 
		   emergency situations. There are, however, still various countries that offer 
		   some degree of anonymity for the caller towards PSAP call takers.</t> 

			<t>The functionality defined in this document, however, far exceeds the amount
			 of information sharing found in the Plain old telephone system (POTS). For 
			 this reason there are additional privacy threats to consider, which are 
			 described in more detail in <xref target="RFC6973"/>.

				<list style="hanging"> 

					<t hangText="Stored Data Compromise:"> 	
		First, there is an increased risk of stored data compromise since additional data is collected and stored in databases. Without adequate measures to secure stored data
   from unauthorized or inappropriate access at access network operators, service providers, end devices, as well as PSAPs  individuals are exposed to potential financial, reputational, or physical harm.</t> 

					<t hangText="Misattribution:">  If the personal data 
   collected and conveyed is incorrect or inaccurate then this may lead to misattribution. Misattribution occurs when data or communications related to one
   individual are attributed to another.</t> 

					<t hangText="Identification:"> By the nature of the additional data and its capability to provide much richer information about the caller, the call, and the location the calling party is identified in a much better way. Some users may feel uncomfortable with this degree of information sharing even in emergency services situations.</t> 

					<t hangText="Secondary Use:"> Furthermore, there is the risk of secondary use. Secondary use is the use of collected information about an individual
   without the individual's consent for a purpose different from that
   for which the information was collected. The stated purpose of the additional data is for emergency services purposes but theoretically the same information could be used for any other call as well. Additionally, parties involved in the emergency call may retain the obtained information and may re-use it for other, non-emergency services purposes.</t>

					<t hangText="Disclosure:"> When the data defined in this document is not properly security (while in transit with traditional communication security techniques, and while at rest using access control mechanisms) there is the risk of disclosure, which is the revelation of information about an individual that affects the way others judge the individual. </t> 

				</list> 
			</t> 

			<t>To mitigate these privacy risks the following countermeasures can be taken.</t>  

			<t>In regions where callers can elect to suppress certain personally identifying information, the network or PSAP functionality can inspect privacy flags within the SIP headers to determine what information may be passed, stored, or displayed to comply with local policy or law. RFC 3325 <xref target="RFC3325"/> defines the "id" priv-value token. The presence of this privacy type in
   a Privacy header field indicates that the user would like the network
   asserted identity to be kept private with respect to SIP entities
   outside the trust domain with which the user authenticated, including the PSAP. </t>

			<t>This document defines various data structures that constitutes personal data. Local regulations	
			may govern what data must be provided in emergency calls, but in	
			general, the emergency call system is often aided by the kinds of	
			information described in this document. There is a tradeoff between	
			the privacy considerations and the utility of the data. For adequate protection this 
			specification requires all data exchanges to be secured via communication security techniques (namely TLS) against eavesdropping and inception. Furthermore, security safeguards are required to prevent unauthorized access to data at rest. Various security incidents over the last 10 years have shown data breaches are not not uncommon and are often caused by lack of proper access control frameworks, software bugs (buffer overflows), or missing input parsing (SQL injection attacks). The risks of data breaches is increased with the obligation for emergency services to retain emergency call related data for extended periods, e.g., several years are the norm. 
			</t>

			<t>Finally, it is also worth to highlight the nature of the SIP communication architecture, which introduces additional complications for privacy. Some forms of data can be sent by value in the SIP signaling or by value (URL in SIP signaling). When data is sent by value, all intermediaries have access to the data. As such, these intermediaries may also introduce additional privacy risk. 
			Therefore, in situations where the conveyed information raises privacy concerns and intermediaries are involved transmitting a reference is more appropriate (assuming proper access control policies are available for distinguishing the different entities dereferencing the reference). Without access control policies any party in possession of the reference is able to resolve the reference and to obtain the data, including intermediaries.</t>
