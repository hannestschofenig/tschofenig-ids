    <abstract>
      <t>When an emergency call is sent to a Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP), the device that sends it, as well as any service
        provider in the path of the call, or access network may have information about the call which the PSAP may be
        able to use. This document describes an XML data structure that contains this kind of
        information in a standardized form. A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) that points to the structure can be included in
        the SIP signaling with the call, or the data may be included in the body of a SIP message. </t>

    <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
    
      <t>As communications devices increasingly utilize the
   Internet to interconnect and communicate, users will expect to use
   such devices to request help. The Internet Protocol suite provides 
   many advantages
   but also requires re-thinking of the traditional emergency calling architecture. 
   The IETF emergency services architecture, as described in <xref target="RFC6443"/> and 
   <xref target="I-D.ietf-ecrit-phonebcp"/>, offers a much richer communication exchange and thereby better 
   situational awareness for call takers. The richness comes in various forms, including the
   multi-media communication capabilities (via voice, video, instant messaging, and real-time text),
   but also via more extensive flow of information. Sharing information between various actors 
   will enable more intelligent decision making and therefore better
        response in case of an emergency. A pre-requisite is to offer the technical capabilities to
        let call takers to gain access to this information stored elsewhere (granted that they are 
        authorized to access it). </t>
   
   <t>In general, there are four types of data exchanged:
   
   <list style="hanging"> 
   <t hangText="Data Associated with a Call:">A lot of information is carried in the call setup procedure itself (as part of the SIP headers as well as in the body of the SIP message, e.g., for example supported capabilities of the device). This also includes information about the emergency caller's identity. </t>
   <t hangText="Data Associated with a Location:">Location information is available via the PIDF-LO element, which includes
   civic and geospatial location, information about the entity that provided the data, information about how the location was obtained (as expressed by the &lt;method&gt; element, see Section 2.2.3 of <xref target="RFC4119"/>, and the values registered in <xref target="iana-method-token"/>), and which entity or
   organization supplied location information (beyond the
   domain information that can be inferred from a signing certificate) available via the &lt;provided-by&gt; element. </t>
   <t hangText="Data Associated with a Caller:">This is personal data about a caller, including medical information.</t>
   <t hangText="Data associated with a PSAP:">When a PSAP handles a call it develops information about the call, which must be passed to subsequent PSAPs, dispatchers and/or responders.</t>
   </list> 
   </t>
   
      <t>When an emergency call is sent to a PSAP, there is a rich set of data in the SIP message used for the call setup,
       but the device, as well as any other service provider in the path may have even
        more information useful for a PSAP. This information may include the identity
        and contact information of the service provider, subscriber identity and contact
        information, the type of service the provider offers, what kind of device the user
        has, etc. Some data is device or service dependent data. For
        example, a car telematics system or service may have crash information. A medical monitoring
        device may have sensor data. While the details of the information may vary by device or
        service, there needs to be a common way to send such data to a PSAP. </t>
        
      <t>This document focuses on the data that can be obtained about a call
   and a mechanism for transporting it in an existing SIP header field,
   the Call-Info header, which is specified in Section 20.9 of <xref target="RFC3261"/>. 
   For this purpose a new token, namely
   'emergencyCallData' is defined to be carried in the "purpose"
   parameter.  If the "purpose" parameter is set to 'emergencyCallData'
   then the Call-Info header contains a HTTPS URL that points to a data
   structure with information about the call or a CID that allows the
   data structure to be placed in the body of the message. <xref target="example"/> shows a SIP INVITE example 
   containing such a Call-Info header. 
   </t>
   <t>Besides a service provider in the path of a call, the access network (which in the IETF emergency call
   architecture provides location in the form of a PIDF-LO <xref target="RFC4119"/>) also has similar information
   that would be valuable to the PSAP.  This information is not specific to the location itsef, but rather to the
   immmediate circumstances about the provision of the location (who the access network is, how to contact that entity, 
   what kind of service the access network provides, possibly subscriber data, etc.).  This data is in nearly every
   respect similar to the data known by services providers in the path of the call.  For this reason,
   this document describes a "provided-by" namespace per <xref target="RFC4119"/> for
   passing information known to the access network.</t>

   <t>The data is defined as a series of "blocks" that represent a class of
   information.  Each of the blocks is a MIME type, and an extensible
   set of these types constitute the data structure.  A registry is
   defined to list the block types that may be included.
   </t>
      <t>The data structure contains an element which itself is a URI that has device or service
        dependent data. Thus the common Additional Data about a Call defined by this document
        contains a 'hook', in the form of a URI, for a device or service dependent data structure.</t>

    <section title="Terminology">
      <t> The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD
        NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
        described in <xref target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>
        
      <t>We use the term 'service' provider to refer to generically refer to application service providers (and a voice service provider is a special form of application service provider).</t> 
      
    </section>

    <!-- ******************************************************************************* -->


    <section title="Call-Info Specification">
    
   <t>The Additional Data about a Call is information specific to a call
   
   <list style="symbols"> 
     <t> known by the user agent software itself, and/or </t>
     <t> known by the a voice/application service provider along the call signaling path, and/or</t>
     <t> known to the provider of the access network to wich the end host is attached to.</t>
   </list> 
   </t>
   <t>The
   Additional Data about a Call is a set of information blocks and each
   block is represented by a MIME type.</t>

   <t>Two mechanisms are provided to transport the data set, namely
   <list style="numbers"> 
   <t>A URI to
   the data set MAY be inserted in a SIP INVITE or MESSAGE transaction
   with a Call-Info header containing a purpose of "emergenyCallData".
   If the data is provided by reference, it may be retrieved with an
   HTTPS Get from the URI.  The URI MUST specify an HTTPS scheme, and
   TLS protection for the data MUST be negotiated.</t>

   <t>The data may be supplied by value in a SIP INVITE or MESSAGE message.
   In this case, Content Indirection (CID) <xref target="RFC2392"/> is used, with the CID URL
   pointing to the body of the message.</t>
   </list> 
   </t>
   
   <t> More than one Call-Info header with an emergencyCallData purpose can be expected. The
        device MAY insert one, and any intermediary service provider MAY insert its own. When there
        are multiple intermediaries, each intermediary MAY each insert one. For example, a device may
        provide one, a telematics service provider may provide one and the mobile carrier handling
        the call may provide one. </t>
        
  <t>Note: The access network MAY supply additional data as well. For this
   purpose, this document defines a namespace and adds the namespace to
   the "provided-by" registry defined by PIDF-LO <xref target="RFC4119"/>.
   Since the PIDF-LO is made available to the end host, to emergency services routing proxies, and to PSAPs
   the access network provided additional data element will be available as well.</t>

   <t>Additional data about a call is defined as a series of MIME objects, each with an XML data 
   structure contained inside.  MIME-multipart is used to enclose the XML documents and the
   sections below define them.</t>

      <t>The information in this data structure will usually be considered private. HTTPS is
        specified to require the provider of the information to validate the credentials of the
        requester. While the creation of a PKI that has global scope may be difficult, the
        alternatives to creating devices and services that can provide critical information securely
        are more daunting.</t>
      <t>The Call-info header with purpose='emergencyCallData' MUST only be sent on an emergency
        call, which can be ascertained by the presence of an emergency service urn in a Route header

      <t>There is much private data in this information. Local regulations
