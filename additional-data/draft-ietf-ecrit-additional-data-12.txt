              Additional Data related to an Emergency Call
                draft-ietf-ecrit-additional-data-12.txt

Abstract

   When an emergency call is sent to a Public Safety Answering Point
   (PSAP), the device that sends it, as well as any application service
   provider in the path of the call, or access network provider through
   which the call originated may have information about the call, the
   caller or the location which the PSAP may be able to use.  This
   document describes data structures and a mechanism to convey such
   data to the PSAP.  The mechanism uses a Uniform Resource Identifier
   (URI), which may point to either an external resource or an object in
   the body of the SIP message.  The mechanism thus allows the data to
   be passed by reference (when the URI points to an external resource)
   or by value (when it points into the body of the message).  This
   follows the tradition of prior emergency services standardization
   work where data can be conveyed by value within the call signaling
   (i.e., in body of the SIP message) and also by reference.

1.  Introduction

   When an IP-based emergency call is initiated a rich set of data from
   multiple data sources is conveyed to the Public Safety Answering
   Point (PSAP).  This data includes information about the calling party
   identity, the multimedia capabilities of the device, the emergency
   service number, location information, and meta-data about the sources
   of the data.  The device, the access network provider, and any
   service provider in the call path may have even more information
   useful for a PSAP.  This document extends the basic set of data
   communicated with an IP-based emergency call, as described in
   [RFC6443] and [RFC6881], in order to carry additional data which may
   be useful to an entity or call taker handling the call.  This data is
   "additional" to the basic information found in the emergency call
   signaling used.

   In general, there are three categories of data communicated in an
   emergency call:

   Data Associated with a Location:  Location data is conveyed in the
      Presence Information Data Format Location Object (PIDF-LO) data
      structure originally defined in RFC 4119 [RFC4119] and extended by
      RFC 5139 [RFC5139] and RFC 6848 [RFC6848] (for civic location
      information), RFC 5491 [RFC5491] and RFC 5962 [RFC5962] (for
      geodetic location information), and

Internet-Draft            Additional Call Data              October 2013


      [I-D.ietf-geopriv-relative-location] (for relative location).
      There may be data that is specific to the location not available
      in the location data structure itself, such as floor plans, tenant
      and building owner contact data, heating, ventilation and air
      conditioning (HVAC) status, etc.

   Data Associated with a Call:  While information is carried in the
      call setup procedure itself (as part of the SIP headers as well as
      in the body of the SIP message), there is additional data known by
      the device making the call, and the service provider along the
      path of the call.  This information may include the service
      provider contact information, subscriber identity and contact
      information, the type of service the service provider and the
      access network provider offer, what kind of device is being used,
      etc.  Some data is device or service dependent data.  For example,
      a car telematics system may have crash information.  A medical
      monitoring device may have sensor data.

   Data Associated with a Caller:  This is personal data about a caller,
      such as medical information and emergency contact data.

   This document only defines data structures relevant to data
   associated with the call but defines extension points for other data
   to be added via other specifications.

   For interoperability, there needs to be a common way for the
   information conveyed to a PSAP to be encoded and identified.
   Identification allows emergency services authorities to know during
   call processing which types of data are present and to determine if
   they wish to access it.  A common encoding allows the data to be
   accessed.

   This document defines the data structures and a way to communicate
   the information in several ways.  Although current standardization
   efforts around IP-based emergency services are focused on the Session
   Initiation Protocol (SIP) and HTTP the data structures in XML format
   described in this document are usable for other communication systems
   as well.  In Section 3 the data structures are defined and the SIP/
   HTTP transport components are defined in Section 4 to offer a clear
   separation between the two.

   More technically, the data structure described in this document is
   represented as one or more "blocks" of information.  Each of the
   blocks is an XML structure with an associated Multipurpose Internet
   Mail Extensions (MIME) type for encapsulation, and an extensible set
   of these types constitute the data set.  A registry is defined to
   list the block types that may be included.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   This document also uses terminology from [RFC5012].  We use the term
   service provider to refer to an Application Service Provider (ASP).
   A Voice Service Provider (VSP) is a special type of ASP.  With the
   term "Access Network Provider" we refer to the Internet Access
   Provider (IAP) and the Internet Service Provider (ISP) without
   further distinguishing these two entities, since the difference
   between the two is not relevant for this document.  Note that the
   roles of ASP and access network provider may be provided by a single
   company.

   In the data block definitions, see Section 3, the values for the
   "Use:" label are specified as one of:

   'Required':  means they MUST be present in the data structure.

   'Conditional':  means they MUST be present if the specified
      condition(s) is met.  They MAY be present if the condition(s) is
      not met.

   'Optional':  means they MAY be present.

   vCard is a data format for representing and exchanging a variety of
   information about individuals and other entities.  For applications
   that use XML the format defined in vCard is not immediately
   applicable.  For this purpose an XML-based encoding of the
   information elements defined in the vCard specification has been
   defined and the name of that specification is xCard.  Since the term
   vCard is more familiar to most readers we use the term xCard and
   vCard interchangeable but it would be accurate to use the term vCard
   only.

3.  Data Structures

   This section defines the following five data structures, each as a
   data block.  For each block we define the MIME type, and the XML data
   structure.  The five data structures are:

   'Data Provider':  This block supplies name and contact information
      for the entity that created the data.  Section 3.1 provides the
      details.

Internet-Draft            Additional Call Data              October 2013


   'Service Information':  This block supplies information about the
      service.  The description can be found in Section 3.2.

   'Device Information':  This block supplies information about the
      device placing the call.  Device information can be found in
      Section 3.3.

   'Owner/Subscriber':  This block supplies information about the owner
      of the device or about the subscriber.  Details can be found in
      Section 3.4.

   'Comment':  This block provides a way to supply free form human
      readable text to the PSAP or emergency responders.  This simple
      structure is defined in Section 3.5.

   Note that the xCard format is re-used in some of the data structures
   to provide contact information.  In an xCard there is no way to
   specify a "main" telephone number.  These numbers are useful to
   emergency responders who are called to a large enterprise.  This
   document adds a new property value to the "tel" property of the TYPE
   parameter called "main".  It can be used in any xCard in additional
   data.

3.1.  Data Provider Information

   This block is intended to be provided by any service provider in the
   path of the call or the access network provider.  It includes
   identification and contact information.  This block SHOULD be
   provided by every service provider in the call path, and by the
   access network provider.  Devices MAY use this block to provide
   identifying information.  The MIME subtype is "application/
   emergencyCall.ProviderInfo+xml".  An access network provider SHOULD
   provide this block either by value or by reference in the Provided-By
   section of a PIDF-LO

3.1.1.  Data Provider String

   Data Element:  Data Provider String

   Use:  Required

   XML Element:  <DataProviderString>

   Description:  This is a plain language string suitable for displaying
      the name of the service provider that created the additional data
      structure.  If the device created the structure the value is
      identical to the contact header in the SIP INVITE.

Internet-Draft            Additional Call Data              October 2013


   Reason for Need:  Inform the call taker of the identity of the entity
      providing the additional call data structure.

   How Used by Call Taker:  Allows the call taker to interpret the data
      in this structure.  The source of the information often influences
      how the information is used, believed or verified.

3.1.2.  Data Provider ID

   Data Element:  Data Provider ID

   Use:  Conditional.  This data SHOULD be provided if the service
      provider or access provider is located in a jurisdiction that
      maintains such ids.  For example, in North America, this would be
      a "NENA Company ID".

   XML Element:  <ProviderID>

   Description:  A jurisdiction specific code for the access provider or
      service provider shown in the <DataProvidedBy> element that
      created the structure of the call.  NOTE: In the US, the NENA
      Company ID must appear here.  Additional information can be found
      at http://www.nena.org/nena-company-id.  The NENA Company ID MUST
      be in the form of a URI in the following format:
      urn:nena:companyid:<NENA Company ID>

   Reason for Need:  Inform the call taker of the identity of the entity
      providing the additional call data structure.

   How Used by Call Taker:  Where jurisdictions have lists of providers
      the Data Provider ID can be useful.

3.1.3.  Data Provider ID Series

   Data Element:  Data Provider ID Series

   Use:  Conditional.  If Data Provider ID is provided, Data Provider ID
      Series is required.

   XML Element:  <ProviderIDSeries>

   Description:  Identifies the issuer of the ProviderId.  A registry
      will reflect the following valid entries:

      *  NENA

3.2.  Service Information

   This block describes the service that the service provider provides
   to the caller.  It SHOULD be included by all SPs in the path of the
   call.  The mime subtype is "application/emergencyCall.SvcInfo+xml".

3.2.1.  Service Environment

   Data Element:  Service Environment

   Use:  Required

   XML Element:  <SvcEnvironment>

   Description:  This element defines whether a call is from a business
      or residence caller.  Currently, the only valid entries are
      'Business' or 'Residence'.

   Reason for Need:  To assist in determining equipment and manpower
      requirements.

   How Used by Call Taker:  Information may be used to assist in
      determining equipment and manpower requirements for emergency
      responders.  As the information is not always available, and the
      registry is not all encompassing, this is at best advisory
      information, but since it mimics a similar capability in some
      current emergency calling systems, it is known to be valuable.
      The service provider uses its best information (such as a rate

      determining the actual characteristics of the location where the
      call originates from.

3.2.2.  Service Delivered by Provider to End User

   Data Element:  Service Delivered by Provider to End User

   Use:  Required

   XML Element:  <SvcDelByProvider>

   Description:  This defines the type of service the end user has
      subscribed to.  The implied mobility of this service cannot be
      relied upon.  A registry with an initial set of values is defined
      in Figure 3.

   | Relay  | Relay Service: a type of service where |
   |        |   there is a human 3rd party agent who |
   |        |   provides some kind of additional     |
   |        |   assistance to the caller.  Includes  |
   |        |   sign language relay and telematics   |
   |        |   services which provide a service     |
   |        |   assistant on the call.               |
   +--------+----------------------------------------+

       Figure 3: Service Delivered by Provider to End User Registry.

      More than one value MAY be returned.  For example, a VoIP inmate
      telephone service is a reasonable combination.

   Reason for Need:  Knowing the type of service may assist the PSAP
      with the handling of the call.

   How Used by Call Taker:  Call takers often use this information to
      determine what kinds of questions to ask callers, and how much to
      rely on supportive information.  An emergency call from a prison
      is treated differently that a call from a sensor device.  As the
      information is not always available, and the registry is not all
      encompassing, this is at best advisory information, but since it
      mimics a similar capability in some current emergency calling
      systems, it is known to be valuable.

3.2.3.  Service Mobility Environment

   Data Element:  Service Mobility Environment

   Use:  Required

   XML Element:  <SvcMobility>

   Description:  This provides the service providers view of the
      mobility of the caller.  As the service provider may not know the
      characteristics of the actual access network used, the value not
      be relied upon.  A registry will reflect the following initial
      valid entries:

      *  Mobile: the device should be able to move at any time

      *  Fixed: the device is not expected to move unless the service is
         relocated

      *  Nomadic: the device is not expected to change its point of
         attachment while on a call

Internet-Draft            Additional Call Data              October 2013


      *  Unknown: no information is known about the service mobility
         environment for the device

   Reason for Need:  Knowing the service provider's belief of mobility
      may assist the PSAP with the handling of the call.

   How Used by Call Taker:  To determine whether to assume the location
      of the caller might change.

3.3.  Device Information

   This block provides information about the device used to place the
   call.  It should be provided by any service provider that knows what
   device is being used, and by the device itself.  The mime subtype is
   "application/emergencyCall.DevInfo+xml".

3.3.1.  Device Classification

   Data Element:  Device Classification

   Use:  Optional

   XML Element:  <DeviceClassification>

   Description:  This data element defines the kind of device making the
      emergency call.  If the device provides the data structure, the
      device information SHOULD be provided.  If the service provider
      provides the structure and it knows what the device is, the
      service provider SHOULD provide the device information.  Often the
      carrier does not know what the device is.  It is possible to
      receive two Additional Data Associated with a Call data
      structures, one created by the device and one created by the
      service provider.  This information describes the device, not how
      it is being used.  This data element defines the kind of device

                 Figure 5: Device Classification Registry.

   Reason for Need:  The device classification implies the capability of
      the calling device and assists in identifying the meaning of the
      emergency call location information that is being presented.  For
      example, does the device require human intervention to initiate a
      call or is this call the result of programmed instructions?  Does
      the calling device have the ability to update location or
      condition changes?  Is this device interactive or a one-way
      reporting device?

   How Used by Call Taker:  May assist with location of caller.  For
      example, a cordless handset may be outside or next door.  May

   Description:  The plain language name of the manufacturer of the
      device.

   Reason for Need:  Used by PSAP management for post-mortem
      investigation/resolution.

   How Used by Call Taker:  Probably not used by the calltaker, but by
      PSAP management.

3.3.3.  Device Model Number

   Data Element:  Device Model Number

   Use:  Optional

   XML Element:  <DeviceModelNr>

   Description:  Model number of the device.

   Reason for Need:  Used by PSAP management for after action

Internet-Draft            Additional Call Data              October 2013


   Reason for Need:  Uniquely identifies the device as opposed to any
      signaling identifiers encountered in the call signaling stream.

   How Used by Call Taker:  Probably not used by the calltaker they
      would need to refer to management for investigation.

3.3.5.  Type of Device Identifier

   Data Element:  Type of Device Identifier

   Use:  Conditional: must be provided if the DeviceID is provided

   XML Element:  <TypeOfDeviceID>

   Description:  Identifies the type of device identifier being
      generated in the unique device identifier data element.  A
      registry with an initial set of values can be seen in Figure 6.

   +--------+----------------------------------------+
   | Token  | Description                            |

Internet-Draft            Additional Call Data              October 2013


   Description:  A URI representing additional data whose schema is
      specific to the device or service which created it.  An example is
      the VEDs structure for a vehicle telematics device.  The URI, when
      dereferenced, MUST yield a data structure defined by the Device/
      service specific additional data type value.  Different data may
      be created by each classification; e.g., telematics creates VEDS
      data set.

   Reason for Need:  Provides device/service specific data that may be
      used by the call taker and/or responders.

   How Used by Call Taker:  Provide information to guide call takers to
      select appropriate responders, give appropriate pre-arrival
      instructions to callers, and advise responders of what to be
      prepared for.  May be used by responders to guide assistance
      provided.

3.3.7.  Device/Service Specific Additional Data Structure Type

   Data Element:  Type of device/service specific additional data
      structure

   Use:  Conditional.  MUST be provided when device/service specific
      additional URI is provided

   XML Element:  <DeviceSpecificType>

   Description:  Value from a registry defined by this document to
      describe the type of data that can be retrieved from the device/
      service specific additional data structure.  Initial values are:

      *  IEEE 1512

      *  VEDS

      IEEE 1512 is the USDoT model for traffic incidents and Vehicular
      Emergency Data Set (VEDS) provides data elements needed for an
      efficient emergency response to vehicular emergency incidents.

   Reason for Need:  This data element allows identification of
      externally defined schemas, which may have additional data that
      may assist in emergency response.

   How Used by Call Taker:  This data element allows the end user
      (calltaker or first responder) to know what type of additional
      data may be available to aid in providing the needed emergency
      services.

Internet-Draft            Additional Call Data              October 2013


   Note:  Information which is specific to a location or a caller
      (person) should not be placed in this section.

3.3.8.  Choosing between defining a new type of block or new type of
        device/service specific additional data

   For devices that have device or service specific data, there are two
   choices to carry it.  A new block can be defined, or the device/
   service specific additional data URL the DevInfo block can be used
   and a new type for it defined .  The data passed would likely be the
   same in both cases.  Considerations for choosing which mechanism to
   register under include:

   Applicability:  Information which will be carried by many kinds of
      devices or services are more appropriately defined as separate
      blocks.

   Privacy:  Information which may contain private data may be better
      sent in the DevInfo block, rather than a new block so that
      implementations are not tempted to send the data by value, and
      thus having more exposure to the data than forcing the data to be
      retrieved via the URL in DevInfo.

   Size:  Information which may be very may be better sent in the
      DevInfo block, rather than a new block so that implementations are
      not tempted to send the data by value.  Conversely, data which is
      small may best be sent in a separate block so that it can be sent
      by value

   Availability of a server:  Providing the data via the device block
      requires a server be made available to retrieve the data.
      Providing the data via new block allows it to be sent by value
      (CID).

3.4.  Owner/Subscriber Information

   This block describes the owner of the device (if provided by the
   device) or the subscriber information, if provided by a service
   provider.  The contact location is not necessarily the location of
   the caller or incident, but is rather the nominal contact address.
   The mime subtype is "application/emergencyCall.Subscriber+xml".

   In some jurisdictions some or all parts of the subscriber-specific
   information are subject to privacy constraints.  These constraints
   vary but dictate what information and be displayed and logged.  A
   general privacy indicator expressing a desire for privacy is
   provided.  The interpretation of how this is applied is left to the
   receiving jurisdiction as the custodians of the local regulatory
   requirements.

3.4.1.  Subscriber Data Privacy Indicator

   Attribute:  privacyRequested, boolean.

   Use:  Mandatory: Specifically expresses the subscriber's desire for
      privacy.

   Description:  In some jurisdictions subscriber services can have a
      specific "Type of Service" which prohibits information such as the
      name of the subscriber from being displayed.  This attribute
      should be used to explicitly indicate whether the subscriber
      service includes such constraints.

   Reason for Need:  Some jurisdictions require subscriber privacy to be
      observed.

   How Used by Call Taker:  Where privacy is indicated the call taker
      MAY not have access to some aspects of the subscriber information.

3.4.2.  xCard for Subscriber's Data

   Data Element:  xCARD for Subscriber's Data

   Use:  Conditional: Some services (e.g., prepaid phones, initialized
      phones, etc.) may not have this information.

   XML Element:  <SubscriberData>

   Description:  Information known by the service provider or device
      about the subscriber; e.g., Name, Address, Individual Telephone
      Number, Main Telephone Number and any other data.  N, ORG (if
      appropriate), ADR, TEL, EMAIL are suggested at a minimum.  If more
      than one TEL property is provided, a parameter from the vCard
      Property Value registry MUST be specified on each TEL.

   Reason for Need:  When the caller is unable to provide information,
      this data may be used to obtain it

   How Used by Call Taker:  Obtaining critical information about the
      caller and possibly the location when it is not able to be
      obtained otherwise.

4.  Transport

   This section defines how to convey additional data to an emergency
   service provider.  Two different means are specified: the first uses
   the call signaling; the second uses the <provided-by> element of a
   PIDF-LO [RFC4119].

   1.  First, the ability to embed a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
       in an existing SIP header field, the Call-Info header, is
       defined.  The URI points to the additional data structure.  The
       Call-Info header is specified in Section 20.9 of [RFC3261].  This
       document adds a new compound token starting with the value
       'emergencyCallData' for the Call-Info "purpose" parameter.  If
       the "purpose" parameter is set to a value starting with
       'emergencyCallData', then the Call-Info header contains either an
       HTTPS URL pointing to an external resource or a CID (content
       indirection) URI that allows the data structure to be placed in
       the body of the SIP message.  The "purpose" parameter also
       indicates the kind of data (by its MIME type) that is available
       at the URI.  As the data is conveyed using a URI in the SIP
       signaling, the data itself may reside on an external resource, or
       may be contained within the body of the SIP message.  When the
       URI refers to data at an external resource, the data is said to
       be passed by reference.  When the URI refers to data contained
       within the body of the SIP message, the data is said to be passed
       by value.  A PSAP or emergency responder is able to examine the

       type of data provided and selectively inspect the data it is
       interested in, while forwarding all of it (the values or
       references) to downstream entities.  To be conveyed in a SIP
       body, additional data about a call is defined as a series of MIME
       objects.  Each block defined in this document is an XML data
       structure identified by its MIME type.  (Blocks defined by others
       may be encoded in XML or not, as identified by their MIME
       registration.)  As usual, whenever more than one MIME part is
       included in the body of a message, MIME-multipart (i.e.,
       'multipart/mixed') encloses them all.  This document defines a
       set of XML schemas and MIME types used for each block defined
       here.  When additional data is passed by value in the SIP
       signaling, each CID URL points to one block in the body.
       Multiple URIs are used within a Call-Info header field (or
       multiple Call-Info header fields) to point to multiple blocks.
       When additional data is provided by reference (in SIP signaling
       or Provided-By), each HTTPS URL references one block; the data is
       retrieved with an HTTPS GET operation, which returns one of the
       blocks as an object (the blocks defined here are returned as XML
       objects).

   2.  Second, the ability to embed additional data structures in the
       <provided-by> element of a PIDF-LO [RFC4119] is defined.  Besides
       a service provider in the call path, the access network provider
       may also have similar information that may be valuable to the
       PSAP.  The access network provider may provide location in the
       form of a PIDF-LO from a location server via a location
       configuration protocol.  The data structures described in this
       document are not specific to the location itself, but rather
       provides descriptive information having to do with the immediate
       circumstances about the provision of the location (who the access
       network is, how to contact that entity, what kind of service the
       access network provides, subscriber information, etc.).  This
       data is similar in nearly every respect to the data known by
       service providers in the path of the call.  When the access
       network provider and service provider are separate entities, the
       access network does not participate in the application layer
       signaling (and hence cannot add a Call-Info header field to the
       SIP message), but may provide location information to assist in
       locating the caller's device.  The <provided-by> element of the
       PIDF-LO is a mechanism for the access network provider to supply
       the information about the entity or organization that supplied
       this location information.  For this reason, this document
       describes a namespace per RFC 4119 for inclusion in the
       <provided-by> element of a PIDF-LO for adding information known
       to the access network provider.

Internet-Draft            Additional Call Data              October 2013


   One or more blocks of data registered in the Emergency Call
   Additional Data registry, as defined in Section 9.1, may be included
   or referenced in the SIP signaling (using the Call-Info header field)
   or in the <provided-by> element of a PIDF-LO.  Every block must be
   one of the types in the registry.  Since the data of an emergency
   call may come from multiple sources, the data itself needs
   information describing the source.  Consequently, each entity adding
   additional data MUST supply the "Data Provider" block.  All other
   blocks are optional, but each entity SHOULD supply any blocks where
   it has at least some of the information in the block.

4.1.  Transmitting Blocks using the Call-Info Header

   A URI to a block MAY be inserted in a SIP request or response method
   (most often INVITE or MESSAGE) with a Call-Info header field
   containing a purpose value starting with 'emergencyCallData' and the
   type of data available at the URI.  The type of data is denoted by
   including the root of the MIME type (not including the
   'emergencyCall' prefix and any suffix such as '+xml') with a '.'
   separator.  For example, when referencing a block with MIME type
   'application/emergencyCall.ProviderInfo+xml', the 'purpose' parameter
   is set to 'emergencyCallData.ProviderInfo'.  An example "Call-Info"
   header field for this would be:

   Call-Info:  https://www.example.com/23sedde3;
       purpose="emergencyCallData.ProviderInfo"

   A Call-info header with a purpose value starting with
   'emergencyCallData' MUST only be sent on an emergency call, which can
   be ascertained by the presence of an emergency service urn in a Route
   header of a SIP message.

   If the data is provided by reference, an HTTPS URI MUST be included
   and consequently Transport Layer Security (TLS) protection is applied
   for protecting the retrieval of the information.

   The data may also be supplied by value in a SIP message.  In this
   case, Content Indirection (CID) [RFC2392] is used, with the CID URL
   referencing the MIME body part.

   More than one Call-Info header with a purpose value starting with
   'emergencyCallData' can be expected, but at least one MUST be
   provided.  The device MUST provide one if it knows no service
   provider is in the path of the call.  The device MAY insert one if it
   uses a service provider.  Any service provider in the path of the
   call MUST insert its own.  For example, a device, a telematics
   service provider in the call path, as well as the mobile carrier
   handling the call will each provide one.  There may be circumstances

Internet-Draft            Additional Call Data              October 2013


   where there is a service provider who is unaware that the call is an
   emergency call and cannot reasonably be expected to determine that it
   is an emergency call.  In that case, that service provider is not
   expected to provide emergencyCallData.

4.2.  Transmitting Blocks by Reference using the Provided-By Element

   The 'emergencyCallDataReference' element is used to transmit an
   additional data block by reference within a 'Provided-By' element of
   a PIDF-LO.  The 'emergencyCallDataReference' element has two
   attributes: 'ref' to specify the URL, and 'purpose' to indicate the
   type of data block referenced.  The value of 'ref' is an HTTPS URL
   that resolves to a data structure with information about the call.
   The value of 'purpose' is the same as used in a 'Call-Info' header
   field (as specified in Section 4.1).

   For example, to reference a block with MIME type 'application/
   emergencyCall.ProviderInfo+xml', the 'purpose' parameter is set to
   'emergencyCallData.ProviderInfo'.  An example
   'emergencyCallDataReference' element for this would be:

      <emergencyCallDataReference ref="https://www.example.com/23sedde3"
      purpose="emergencyCallData.ProviderInfo"/>

4.3.  Transmitting Blocks by Value using the Provided-By Element

   It is RECOMMENDED that access networks supply the data specified in
   this document by reference, but they MAY provide the data by value.

   The 'emergencyCallDataValue' element is used to transmit an
   additional data block by value within a 'Provided-By' element of a
   PIDF-LO.  The 'emergencyCallDataValue' element has one attribute:
   'purpose' to indicate the type of data block contained.  The value of
   'purpose' is the same as used in a 'Call-Info' header field (as
   specified in Section 4.1, and in Section 4.1).  The same XML
   structure as would be contained in the corresponding MIME type body
   part is placed inside the 'emergencyCallDataValue' element.

   For example:


         <provided-by
           xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:emergencyCallAddlData">
           <emergencyCallData>
             <byRef purpose="emergencyCallData.SvcInfo"
                    ref="https://example.com/ref2"/>
             <sub:emergencyCall.Comment
               xmlns:sub="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:emergencyCall.Comment">

         </provided-by>

4.4.  The Content-Disposition Parameter

   RFC 5621 [RFC5621] discusses the handling of message bodies in SIP.
   It updates and clarifies handling originally defined in RFC 3261
   [RFC3261] based on implementation experience.  While RFC 3261 did not
   mandate support for 'multipart' message bodies 'multipart/mixed' MIME
   bodies are, however, used by many extensions (including additional
   data) today.  For example, adding a PIDF-LO, SDP, and additional data
   in body of a SIP message requires a 'multipart' message body.

   RFC 3204 [RFC3204] and RFC 3459 [RFC3459] define the 'handling'
   parameter for the Content-Disposition header field.  These RFCs
   describe how a UAS reacts if it receives a message body whose content
   type or disposition type it does not understand.  If the 'handling'
   parameter has the value "optional", the UAS ignores the message body.
   If the 'handling' parameter has the value "required", the UAS returns
   a 415 (Unsupported Media Type) response.  The 'by-reference'
   disposition type allows a SIP message to contain a reference to the
   body part, and the SIP UA processes the body part according to the
   reference.  This is the case for the Call-info header containing a
   Content Indirection (CID) URL.

   As an example, a SIP message indicates the Content-Disposition
   parameter in the body of the SIP message as shown in Figure 10.


         Content-Type: application/sdp

7.  Security Considerations

   The information in this data structure will usually be considered
   private.  HTTPS is specified to require the provider of the
   information to validate the credentials of the requester.  While the
   creation of a PKI that has global scope may be difficult, the
   alternatives to creating devices and services that can provide
   critical information securely are more daunting.  The provider may
   enforce any policy it wishes to use, but PSAPs and responder agencies
   should deploy a PKI so that providers of additional data can check
   the certificate of the client and decide the appropriate policy to
   enforce based on that certificate.

   Ideally, the PSAP and emergency responders will be given credentials
   signed by an authority trusted by the data provider.  In most
   circumstances, nationally recognized credentials would be sufficient,
   and if the emergency services arranges a PKI, data providers could be
   provisioned with the root CA public key for a given nation.  Some
   nations are developing a PKI for this, and related, purposes.  Since
   calls could be made from devices where the device and/or the service
   provider(s) are not local to the emergency authorities, globally
   recognized credentials are useful.  This might be accomplished by
   extending the notion of the "forest guide" described in [RFC5222] to
   allow the forest guide to provide the credential of the PKI root for
   areas that it has coverage information for, but standards for such a

   mechanism are not yet available.  In its absence, the data provider
   will need to obtain the root CA credentials for any areas it is
   willing to provide additional data by out of band means.  With the
   credential of the root CA for a national emergency services PKI, the
   data provider server can validate the credentials of an entity
   requesting additional data by reference.

   The data provider also needs a credential that can be verified by the
   emergency services to know that it is receiving data from the right
   server.  The emergency authorities could provide credentials,
   distinguishable from credentials it provides to emergency responders
   and PSAPs, which could be used to validate data providers.  Such
   credentials would have to be acceptable to any PSAP or responder that
   could receive a call with additional data supplied by that provider.
   This would be extensible to global credential validation using the
   forest guide as above.  In the absence of such credentials, the
   emergency authorities could maintain a list of local data providers'
   credentials provided to it out of band.  At a minimum, the emergency
   authorities could obtain a credential from the DNS entry of the
   domain in the Additional Data URI to at least validate that the
   server is known to the domain providing the URI.

   Data provided by devices by reference have similar credential
   validation issues to service providers, and the solutions are the
   same.

8.  Privacy Considerations

   This document enables functionality for conveying additional
   information about the caller to the callee.  Some of this information
   is personal data and therefore privacy concerns arise.  An explicit
   privacy indicator for information directly relating to the callers
   identity is defined and use is mandatory.  However, observance of
   this request for privacy and what information it relates to is
   controlled by the destination jurisdiction.

   There are a number of privacy concerns with regular real-time
   communication services that are also applicable to emergency calling.
   Data protection regulation world-wide has, however, decided to create
   exceptions for emergency services since the drawbacks of disclosing
   personal data in comparison to the benefit for the emergency caller
   are often towards the latter.  Hence, the data protection rights of
   individuals are often waived for emergency situations.  There are,
   however, still various countries that offer some degree of anonymity
   for the caller towards PSAP call takers.

   The functionality defined in this document, however, far exceeds the
   amount of information sharing found in the Plain old telephone system

   (POTS).  For this reason there are additional privacy threats to
   consider, which are described in more detail in [RFC6973].

   Stored Data Compromise:  First, there is an increased risk of stored
      data compromise since additional data is collected and stored in
      databases.  Without adequate measures to secure stored data from
      unauthorized or inappropriate access at access network operators,
      service providers, end devices, as well as PSAPs individuals are
      exposed to potential financial, reputational, or physical harm.

   Misattribution:  If the personal data collected and conveyed is
      incorrect or inaccurate then this may lead to misattribution.
      Misattribution occurs when data or communications related to one
      individual are attributed to another.

   Identification:  By the nature of the additional data and its
      capability to provide much richer information about the caller,
      the call, and the location the calling party is identified in a
      much better way.  Some users may feel uncomfortable with this
      degree of information sharing even in emergency services
      situations.

   Secondary Use:  Furthermore, there is the risk of secondary use.
      Secondary use is the use of collected information about an
      individual without the individual's consent for a purpose
      different from that for which the information was collected.  The
      stated purpose of the additional data is for emergency services
      purposes but theoretically the same information could be used for
      any other call as well.  Additionally, parties involved in the
      emergency call may retain the obtained information and may re-use
      it for other, non-emergency services purposes.

   Disclosure:  When the data defined in this document is not properly
      security (while in transit with traditional communication security
      techniques, and while at rest using access control mechanisms)
      there is the risk of disclosure, which is the revelation of
      information about an individual that affects the way others judge
      the individual.

   To mitigate these privacy risks the following countermeasures can be
   taken.

   In regions where callers can elect to suppress certain personally
   identifying information, the network or PSAP functionality can
   inspect privacy flags within the SIP headers to determine what
   information may be passed, stored, or displayed to comply with local
   policy or law.  RFC 3325 [RFC3325] defines the "id" priv-value token.
   The presence of this privacy type in a Privacy header field indicates

Internet-Draft            Additional Call Data              October 2013


   that the user would like the network asserted identity to be kept
   private with respect to SIP entities outside the trust domain with
   which the user authenticated, including the PSAP.

   This document defines various data structures that constitutes
   personal data.  Local regulations may govern what data must be
   provided in emergency calls, but in general, the emergency call
   system is often aided by the kinds of information described in this
   document.  There is a tradeoff between the privacy considerations and
   the utility of the data.  For adequate protection this specification
   requires all data exchanges to be secured via communication security
   techniques (namely TLS) against eavesdropping and inception.
   Furthermore, security safeguards are required to prevent unauthorized
   access to data at rest.  Various security incidents over the last 10
   years have shown data breaches are not not uncommon and are often
   caused by lack of proper access control frameworks, software bugs
   (buffer overflows), or missing input parsing (SQL injection attacks).
   The risks of data breaches is increased with the obligation for
   emergency services to retain emergency call related data for extended
   periods, e.g., several years are the norm.

   Finally, it is also worth to highlight the nature of the SIP
   communication architecture, which introduces additional complications
   for privacy.  Some forms of data can be sent by value in the SIP
   signaling or by value (URL in SIP signaling).  When data is sent by
   value, all intermediaries have access to the data.  As such, these
   intermediaries may also introduce additional privacy risk.
   Therefore, in situations where the conveyed information raises
   privacy concerns and intermediaries are involved transmitting a
   reference is more appropriate (assuming proper access control
   policies are available for distinguishing the different entities
   dereferencing the reference).  Without access control policies any
   party in possession of the reference is able to resolve the reference
   and to obtain the data, including intermediaries.
