Abstract

   This document defines an extension for end to end authentication,
   integrity and confidentiality protection of Diameter Attribute Value
   Pairs.  The solutions focuses on protecting Diameter Attribute Value
   Pairs and leaves the key distribution solution to a separate
   specification.  The integrity protection can be introduced in a
   backward compatible manner to existing application.  The
   confidentiality protection requires an explicit support from an
   application, thus is applicable only for newly defined applications.

1.  Introduction

   The Diameter base protocol [RFC6733] leverages IPsec and TLS for
   mutual authentication between neighboring Diameter nodes and for
   channel security offering data origin authentication, integrity and
   confidentiality protection.  The Diameter base protocol, however,
   also defines Diameter agents, namely Relay Agents, Proxy Agents,
   Redirect Agents, and Translation Agents.

Internet-Draft            Diameter E2E Security                July 2013


   Relay Agents are Diameter agents that accept requests and route
   messages to other Diameter nodes based on information found in the
   messages.  Since Relays do not perform any application level
   processing, they provide relaying services for all Diameter
   applications.

   Similarly to Relays, Proxy Agents route Diameter messages using the
   Diameter routing table.  However, they differ since they modify
   messages to implement policy enforcement.

   Redirect Agents do not relay messages, and only return an answer with
   the information necessary for Diameter agents to communicate
   directly, they do not modify messages.  Redirect Agents do not have
   negative impacts on end-to-end security and are therefore not
   considered in this document.

   A Translation Agent is a device that provides translation between two
   protocols.  To offer end-to-end security across different protocol
   requires the ability to convey and process the AVPs defined in this
   document by both end points.  Since such support is very likely not
   available this document does not cover this functionality.

   The Diameter extension defined in this document specifies how AVP
   authentication, integrity and confidentiality protection can be
   offered using either symmetric or asymmetric cryptography.  As a
   solution mechanism is derived form Javascript Object Signing and
   Encryption (JOSE).  JOSE offers a simple encoding with small set of
   features ideal for the purpose of Diameter.  This document further
   defines a binary efficient coding of JOSE objects.

   This document focuses on protecting Diameter AVP and leaves the key
   distribution solution to a separate specification, which most likely
   is going to be a specific key exchange application.  To offer the
   functionality two grouped AVPs are defined: Signed-Data and
   Encrypted-Data.  The respective JOSE objects are transported within
   these two AVPs.

2.  Solution description

2.1.  Integrity protection of AVPs

   JWS represents digitally signed or HMACed content using JSON data
   structures.  The representation in [I-D.ietf-jose-json-web-signature]
   consists of three parts: the JWS Header, the JWS Payload, and the JWS
   Signature.  The three parts are represented as the concatenation of
   the encoded strings in that order, with the three strings being
   separated by period ('.') characters.  For the JWS Payload one would
   define a new JSON object that contains an array of AVP code number



Korhonen & Tschofenig   Expires January 16, 2014                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft            Diameter E2E Security                July 2013


   and a hash of AVP pairs.  The JWS Signature then covers the all APVs
   to be signed or HMACed.  Both JWS Payload and signature MUST use the
   same hash algorithm of the cryptographic algorithm indicated in the
   JWS Header.

   Although the solution relies on the JSON, the encoding into Diameter
   AVPs differ from the text based encoding of the JSON objects.
   Specifically, none of of the JWS Header, JWS Payload or JWS Signature
   are not BASE64 encoded but are processed in their plaintext or binary
   representation formats.  For example, the JWS Header is encoded in
   its plaintext format into the Header-Parameters AVP:

   {  "typ":"JWT",
      "alg":"HS256",
      "kid":"abc123"
   }


   The JWS Payload and the JWS Signature hashes and AVP Code values are
   encoded in their binary format as octets, not in textual or BASE64
   encoded formats.  Sections 3.4 and 3.5 describe the encodings of the
   needed AVPs.

   To package a set of AVPs for signing, each AVP octet representation
   to be protected are first individually hashed and encoded into the
   "JSON object" with its four octets AVP code number.  The entire AVP
   MUST be input to the hash calculation, from the first byte of the AVP
   code to the last byte of the AVP data, including all other fields,
   length, reserved/flags, and optional vendor IDs, and padding.  The
   AVP MUST be input to the hash calculation in network byte order.

   The JWS Signature is calculated over the entire JWS Payloads and then
   the all three JWS parts are placed in the Signed-Data AVP.  There can
   be multiple Signed-Data AVPs in a Diameter message.  The AVP code in
   the JWS Payload is to indicate which AVP this hash possibly refers
   to.  If there are multiple instances of the same AVP in the Diameter
   message, there is no other way than make the verification against all
   of those.  It is possible that the message sender only hashed one AVP
   of the same type and, therefore, the receiver MUST verify the hash
   against all occurrences of the AVP of the same code number.  Such
   flexibility is added there to allow reordering of the AVPs and
   addition or deletion of new AVPs by intermediating agents.

   If a receiver detects errors with the processing of the Signed-Data
   AVP it MAY return one of the errors defined in Section 4.  If a
   receiver does not find any AVP the Signed-Data AVP has a signature
   for, it MAY also return one of the errors defined in Section 4.

   When AVPs are to be both encrypted and signed, the Encrypted-Data AVP
   MUST be created first.  This means that signing is "outside"
   encryption.

   Here is an example: Imagine the following AVPs from the QoS-Resources
   AVP in the QoS-Install Request (defined in RFC 5866 [RFC5866] message
   shall be signed.  The resulting example message has the following
   structure:

   <QoS-Install-Request> ::= < Diameter Header: 327, REQ, PXY >
                             < Session-Id >
                             { Auth-Application-Id }
                             { Origin-Host }
                             { Origin-Realm }
                             { Destination-Realm }
                             { Auth-Request-Type }
                             [ Signed-Data ]
                           * [ QoS-Resources ]
                             ...

               Example Diameter Message with Signed-Data AVP

   The Signed-Data AVP in this example may contain a JWS Header that
   indicates the use of the HMAC SHA-256 algorithm with the key id
   'abc123'.  The protected AVPs are Session-Id, Origin-Host and Origin-
   Realm.  The calculated HMAC SHA-256 values are for example purposes
   only (i.e., are not real):

   JWS Header encoded as such in JWS-Header AVP:

    {"typ":"JWT",
     "alg":"HS256",
     "kid":"abc123"
    }

   0x00000xxx  // JWS-Header code 'xxx'
   0x00000034  // Flags=0, Length=52
   '{"typ":"JWT","alg":"HS256","kid":"abc123"}'  // 41
   0x00,0x00,0x00  // 3 octets padding

   JWS Payload encoded into three JWS-AVP-Payload AVPs:

   0x00000zzz  // JWS-AVP-Payload code 'zzz'    <--+
   0x0000001c  // Flags=0, Length=28               |

   0xaabbccdd,0xddeeff00,0x11223344,0x55667788

                 Example JWS Header, Payload and Signature

2.2.  Confidentiality protection of AVPs

   The Encrypted-Data AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type OctetString and
   contains the JSON Web Encryption (JWE)
   [I-D.ietf-jose-json-web-encryption] data structure and consists of
   four parts: the JWE Header, the JWE Encrypted Key, the JWE
   Initialization Vector and the JWE Ciphertext.  The four parts are
   represented as the concatenation of the encoded strings in that
   order, with the three strings being separated by period ('.')
   characters.  JWE does not add a content integrity check if not
   provided by the underlying encryption algorithm.

   Although the solution relies on the JSON, the encoding into Diameter
   AVPs differ from the text based encoding of the JSON objects.
   Specifically, none of of the the JWE Header, the JWE Encrypted Key,
   the JWE Initialization Vector and the JWE Ciphertext are not BASE64
   encoded but are processed in their plaintext or binary representation
   formats.  The concept follows what was already described in
   Section 2.1.

   A single AVP or an entire list of AVPs MUST be input to the
   encryption process, from the first byte of the AVP code to the last



Korhonen & Tschofenig   Expires January 16, 2014                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft            Diameter E2E Security                July 2013


   byte of the AVP data, including all other fields, length, reserved/
   flags, and optional vendor IDs, and padding.  The AVP MUST be input
   to the encryption process in network byte order, and the encryptor is
   free to order AVPs whatever way it chooses.  When AVPs are to be both
   encrypted and authenticated, the Encrypted-Data AVP MUST be created
   first.

   Note that the usage of the Encrypted-Data AVP requires explicit
   support by the Diameter application since a receiving Diameter node
   must first decrypt the content of the Encrypted-Data AVP in order to
   evaluate the AVPs carried in the message.  In case that a Diameter
   node is unable to understand the Encrypted-Data AVP and ignores the
   AVP then two possible outcomes are possible: First, if the encrypted
   AVPs are optional then their content is not considered by the
   receiving Diameter server without any indication to the sender that
   they have not been processes.  Worse, in the second case when the
   encrypted AVPs are mandatory to be processed then the receiving
   Diameter node will return an error that may not inform the sender
   about the failure to decrypt the Encrypted-Data AVP.  Consequently,
   the usage of the Encrypted-Data AVP may require changes to the ABNF
   definition of a Diameter application.

   If a receiver detects that the contents of the Encrypted-Data AVP is
   invalid, it SHOULD return the new Result-Code AVP value defined in
   Section 4.

2.3.  Definition of the 'End Point'

   Although this specification claims to introduce the end-to-end
   security into Diameter, the definition who actually is the 'end
   point' is not obvious.  The 'end point' does not need to be the
   original Diameter request or answer originator but the Diameter node
   that inserts the Signed-Data or the Encrypted-Data AVPs into the
   Diameter message.  The node can be the request or answer originator
   or a proxy agent.  Use of proxy agents doing the 'end-to-end'
   security on behalf of other nodes mimics the deployments where site-
   to-site VPNs are used.

3.  AVP Encoding

3.1.  Signed-Data AVP

   The Signed-Data AVP (AVP Code TBD1) is of type Grouped and utilizes
   the JSON Web signature (JWS) mechanism defined in
   [I-D.ietf-jose-json-web-signature].  The JWS payload is then encoded
   into the Signed-Data AVP:

Internet-Draft            Diameter E2E Security                July 2013


   Signed-Data  ::= < AVP Header: TBD1 >
                    { JWS-Header }
                  * { JWS-AVP-Payload }
                    { JWS-Signature }
                  * [ AVP ]


3.2.  JWS-Header AVP

   The JWS-Header AVP (AVP Code TBD2) is of type UTF8String and contains
   the JSON Web Signature Header.  The contents of the AVP follow the
   rules for the header found in [I-D.ietf-jose-json-web-signature],
   which implies the required IANA registries are also defined by JSON
   documents.

   JWS-Header  ::= < AVP Header: TBD2 >
                   { Header-Parameters }
                 * [ AVP ]


   The "alg" is the only REQUIRED Header Parameter for the signature
   purposes.  The "typ" and "kid" Header Parameters are also
   RECOMMENDED.

3.3.  Header-Parameters AVP

   The Header-Parameters AVP (AVP Code TBD3) is of type UTF8String and
   contains the JSON Header Parameter Name and its value as described in
   [I-D.ietf-jose-json-web-signature].  The encoding (textual) also
   follows [I-D.ietf-jose-json-web-signature].  Differing from the JSON
   specifications the parameter names and values are not BASE64 encoded
   but in their original UTF-8 representation format.

3.4.  JWS-AVP-Payload AVP

   The JWS-AVP-Payload AVP (AVP Code TBD4) is of type OctetString and
   contains both an AVP Code and a hash of the entire AVP identified by
   the AVP Code.  The first four octets contain the AVP Code in a
   network byte order followed by the hash octets.  The length of the
   hash octets depends on the used hash algorithm.

3.5.  JWS-Signature AVP

   The JWS-Signature AVP (AVP Code TBD5) is of type OctetString and
   contains the signature calculated over the array of complete JWS-AVP-
   Payload AVPs (including AVP header fields etc) in the order they
   appear in the Signed-Data AVP.  The length of the signature octets
   depends on the used signature algorithm.

3.6.  Encrypted-Data AVP

   The Encrypted-Data AVP (AVP Code TBD6) is of type Grouped and
   utilizes the JSON Web Encryption (JWE) mechanism defined in
   [I-D.ietf-jose-json-web-encryption].  The JWE payload is then encoded
   into the Encrypted-Data AVP:

   Encrypted-Data  ::= < AVP Header: TBD1 >
                       { JWE-Header }
                       { JWE-Enc-Key }
                       [ JWE-Init-Vec ]
                       { JWE-AVP-Ciphertext }
                     * [ AVP ]


3.7.  JWE-Header AVP

   The JWE-Header AVP (AVP Code TBD7) is of type UTF8String and contains
   the JSON Web Encryption Header.  The contents of the AVP follow the
   rules for the header found in [I-D.ietf-jose-json-web-encryption],
   which implies the required IANA registries are also defined by JSON
   documents.

   JWE-Header  ::= < AVP Header: TBD7 >
                   { Header-Parameters }
                 * [ AVP ]


   The "alg" and "enc" are the REQUIRED Header Parameter for the
   encryption purposes.  The "typ" and "kid" Header Parameters are also
   RECOMMENDED.

3.8.  JWE-Enc-Key AVP

   The JWE-Enc-Key AVP (AVP Code TBD8) is of type OctetString and
   contains the JWE Encrypted Key in its binary format.

3.9.  JWE-Init-Vec AVP

   The JWE-Init-Vec AVP (AVP Code TBD9) is of type OctetString and
   contains the JWE Initialization Vector in its binary format.

3.10.  JWE-AVP-Ciphertext AVP

   The JWE-AVP-Ciphertext AVP (AVP Code TBD10) is of type OctetString
   and contains the encrypted AVPs.  The encrypted AVPs are first
   concatenated into one large plaintext octet blob and then encrypted
   as a whole.  The length of the ciphertext depends on the used

   algorithm and encrypted AVPs.  The plaintext to be encrypted is never
   BASE64 encoded but MAY be compressed if a "zip" parameter was
   included in the JWE Header.

4.  Result-Code AVP Values

   This section defines new Diameter result code values for usage with
   Diameter applications.

4.1.  Transient Failures

   Errors that fall within the transient failures category are used to
   inform a peer that the request could not be satisfied at the time it
   was received, but MAY be able to satisfy the request in the future.

   DIAMETER_KEY_UNKNOWN (TBD11)

      This error code is returned when a Signed-Data or an Encrypted-
      Data AVP is received that was generated using a key that cannot be
      found in the key store.  This error may, for example, be caused if
      one of the endpoints of an end-to-end security association lost a
      previously agreed upon key, perhaps as a result of a reboot.  To
      recover a new end-to-end key establishment procedure may need to
      be invoked.

   DIAMETER_HEADER_NAME_ERROR (TBD12)

      This error code is returned when a Header Parameter Name is not
      understood in the JWS-Header AVP or in the JWE-Header AVP.

4.2.  Permanent Failures

   Errors that fall within the permanent failures category are used to
   inform the peer that the request failed, and should not be attempted
   again.

   DIAMETER_DECRYPTION_ERROR (TBD13)

      This error code is returned when an Encrypted-Data AVP is received
      and the decryption fails for an unknown reason.

   DIAMETER_SIGNATURE_ERROR (TBD14)

      This error code is returned when a Signed-Data AVP is received and
      the verification fails for an unknown reason.

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate AVP codes for the following AVPs:

   |JWE-Enc-Key                          TBD8   3.x       OctetString |
   |JWE-Init-Vec                         TBD9   3.x       OctetString |
   |JWE-AVP-Ciphertext                   TBD10  3.x       OctetString |
   +------------------------------------------------------------------+


   This specification additionally defines a few Result-Code AVP values,
   see Section 4.

6.  Security Considerations

   The purpose of this document is to offer end-to-end security
   mechanisms for calculating keyed message digest, for signing, and for
   encryption of Diameter AVPs.

   An intermediate Diameter agent that for a reason or other reorders
   the AVPs within the Signed-Data AVP may cause the signature
   verification fail even if no AVP was actually tampered.
