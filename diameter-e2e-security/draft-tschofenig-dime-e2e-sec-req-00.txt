Internet-Draft         Diameter AVP Level Security         February 2013


1.  Introduction

   The Diameter Base specification [1] offers security protection
   between neighboring Diameter peers and mandates that either TLS (for
   TCP), DTLS (for SCTP), or IPsec is used.  These security protocols
   offer a wide range of security properties, including entity
   authentication, data-origin authentication, integrity,
   confidentiality protection and replay protection.  They also support
   a large number of cryptographic algorithms, algorithm negotiation,
   and different types of credentials.

   The need to also offer additional security protection of AVPs between
   non-neighboring Diameter nodes was recognized very early in the work
   on Diameter.  This lead to investigations on a Diameter security
   extension using Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) [3].  Due to lack
   of deployment interest at that time the specification was, however,
   never completed.

   In the meanwhile Diameter had received a lot of deployment interest
   and due to the sophistication of those deployments the need for
   protecting Diameter AVPs between non-neighboring nodes re-surfaced.
   Since early 2000 when the work on [3] was discontinued the community
   had seen advances in cryptography and new requirements emerged.

   This document collects requirements for protecting Diameter AVPs.

      QUESTION:  What should the scope of the document be?  We could
      focus on requirements document or we could cover architectural
      aspects.  We are assuming that requirements for automatic key
      management are out of scope.  Is this proper scoping?

2.  Terminology

   The key words 'MUST', 'MUST NOT', 'REQUIRED', 'SHALL', 'SHALL NOT',
   'SHOULD', 'SHOULD NOT', 'RECOMMENDED', 'MAY', and 'OPTIONAL' in this
   specification are to be interpreted as described in [2].

3.  Use Case

   Consider the following use case shown in Figure 1.  A Diameter client
   interacts with a Diameter server through two Diameter proxies.  The
   Diameter client and the Diameter Proxy A belong to the same realm,
   example.com.


   ****************************
                              *
      Realm: Example.com      *
   +--------+      +--------+ *      +--------+        +--------+
   |Diameter|      |Diameter| *      |Diameter|        |Diameter|
   |Client  +------+Proxy A +-*------+Proxy B +--------+Server  |
   +--------+      +--------+ *      +--------+        +--------+
       ^                      *                             ^
       .           End-to-End * Security Protection         .
       +......................*.............................+
                              *
   ****************************


               Figure 1: Example Diameter Deployment Setup.

   The Diameter AVPs are protected end-to-end, from the Diameter client
   to the Diameter server, as shown in Figure 1 with the dotted line.

   Other use cases are possible as well.  For example, Diameter Proxy A
   could act on behalf of the Diameter clients in the example.com realm.
   In a general case, however, encryption of AVPs between arbitrary
   Diameter nodes can be challenging since it is upfront not know what
   Diameter nodes a message will traverse.

      QUESTION:  Should the scope of the work be limited to provide data
      origin authentication, integrity, and optionally confidentially
      protection between of selected Diameter AVPs sent by the Diameter
      client to the Diameter server, and vice versa?

4.  Requirements

   Solutions MUST support an extensible set of cryptographic algorithms.

      Motivation:  Crypto-agility is the ability of a protocol to adapt
      to evolving cryptographic algorithms and security requirements.
      This may include the provision of a modular mechanism to allow
      cryptographic algorithms to be updated without substantial
      disruption to deployed implementations.

   Solutions MUST support replay protection.

   Solutions MUST support confidentiality, integrity, and data-origin
   authentication.

   Solutions MUST be able to selectively apply their cryptographic
   protection to certain Diameter AVPs.

   Solutions MUST recommend a mandatory-to-implement cryptographic
   algorithm.

      QUESTION:  Should solutions for integrity protection work in a
      backwards-compatible way with existing Diameter applications that
      support extensions?

      QUESTION:  Should we support symmetric keys or also asymmetric
      keys?

      QUESTION:  Should statically provisioned keys be supported as well
      or only automatic key management?  Should requirements for
      automatic key management also be covered in this document or in
      some other document?

      QUESTION:  Should the specification be written in such a way that
      it allows the provisioning of long-term shared symmetric
      credentials via a command-line interface / text file in an
      interoperable way?  This would allow simplified configuration.
