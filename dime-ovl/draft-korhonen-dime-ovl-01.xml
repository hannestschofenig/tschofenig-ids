<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
 <t>The existing toolbox offered by the Diameter Base Protocol <xref 
  target="RFC6733"/> to prevent and recover from signaling overload situations 
  is rather limited. Apart from out-of-band altering of the transport 
  connection congestion control behavior or other non-standard 
  application level throttling, the protocol error DIAMETER_TOO_BUSY, the 
  permanent error DIAMETER_UNABLE_TO_COMPLY (for some unspecified reason) and
  the Disconnect-Cause Attribute Value Pair (AVP) code BUSY or
  DO_NOT_WANT_TO_TALK_TO_YOU are more or less all there is. Unfortunately, the
  mentioned three indications are coarse, concern one peer connection at a time
  or lack detailed information for problem diagnosis and mitigation. They also
  treat all applications in a single Diameter node (identified by a single
  DiameterIdentity) as a lump. There is no way communicate any kind of grouping
  of applications or what is the scope/partitioning of the delivered 
  information. Furthermore, there is no way to signal when the overload
  situation is over. The request initiator and forwarders are therefore forced 
  to keep re-submitting their messages to determine whether the situation has 
  changed.</t>
  
 <t>The situation is further complicated by the hop-by-hop nature of Diameter
  deployments. This makes the propagation of possible overload situation 
  information non-trivial, even for existing protocol errors since every
  intermediate Diameter node is allowed to react to the error situation. Either the information is
  never propagated to the originator of the request or it takes an unacceptable 
  long time.</t>
  
 <t>A problem statement of overload control for Diameter and requirements 
  are documented in <xref target="I-D.ietf-dime-overload-reqs"/>. This
  specification describes a solution to the Diameter overload Diameter 
  Overload Control Application (DOCA), which fulfills the requirements of 
  <xref target="I-D.ietf-dime-overload-reqs"/> and defines a Diameter
  application to convey overload information between Diameter nodes.</t>
  
  <t>Note: The recent publication of <xref target="I-D.campbell-dime-overload-data-analysis"/> 
  illustrates the overload information data model and the design space. As the working group makes progress in deciding about specific 
features this document will be updated accordingly.</t>

<section title="Requirements">
   <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
   target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.

<!-- ******************************************************************** -->
  
<section title="DOCA Overview">

  <t>Any the DOCA capable Diameter 
    node MAY initiate a DOCA-Report-Request at any given time. The receiver of
    the DOCA-Report-Request acknowledges with a DOCA-Report-Answer and includes
    the Result-Code AVP indicating whether it
    could honor the action/report in the request. The DOCA-Report-Answer SHOULD
    also piggyback overload control information.
  </t>
  
    <t>A DOCA client MUST
   set the Auth-Session-State AVP to the value NO_STATE_MAINTAINED and SHOULD 
   include the OC-Information AVP with overload information into the
   DOCA-Report-Request, if available. The 
   DOCA-Report-Response message MUST contain the Auth-Session-State AVP set to
   value NO_STATE_MAINTAINED.
  </t>
  
  <t>Note that information exchanges regarding various DOCA related
   timers serve only as a hint since they cannot be enforced.
   Consequently, care should be taken not to send DOCA-Report-Requests too frequently. 
   </t>

   <t>When a Diameter node receives overload control information and is also
    requested to act on it, the DOCA functionality is applied to all specified
    applications within a given scope. How the Diameter node accomplishes the
    node wide DOCA action enforcement is implementation specific.
   </t>
   
   <t>When a Diameter node receives (interim) overload information but the
    overload condition has not exceeded a certain threshold, then the receiver is not required
    to act based on the received information. However, it is RECOMMENDED that
    the receiver makes proactive actions to avoid entering the overload 
    condition based on the newly received overload information.
   </t>
   
   <t>There may be zero or more intermediate Diameter agents on the path between
    the DOCA client and the DOCA server. Understanding the DOCA functionality is not
    expected from relays and redirect agents. A Diameter proxy, which 
    obviously understands the DOCA application, MAY inspect the DOCA related 
    AVPs in the DOCA-Report-Request/Answer message pair and depending on the 
    value of the OC-Scope AVP (see <xref target="oc-scope"/>) inject its own 
    information. A proxy is always RECOMMENDED to react according to the
    overload information when it comes to, for example, peer selection and
    traffic throttling.
   </t>
   
   <t>When a Diameter agent receives overload control information and is also
    requested to act on it, the DOCA functionality is applied to all specified
    applications within a given scope. How the Diameter agent accomplishes the
    node wide DOCA action enforcement is implementation specific.

  <t>The DOCA-Report-Request (DRR) message is used to report overload condition  
   information. The message can be originated as a 
   result of emerging overload condition or as a periodic unsolicited report.

  <t>A scope is active when a corresponding flag is set in the OC-Scope AVP.
   During the initialization state a DOCA client includes those scopes it
   supports and is interested in. A DOCA server then returns the scope
   that it has in common with the DOCA client (and intends to use). The common
   scopes are then used during the established state. Note that some scope
   combinations make little sense while still being valid.  The general guide
   when multiple scopes collide is that the least restrictive wins.
  </t>
  <t>A sender of the overload information MUST adhere to the scope it announces
   regarding the information it itself sends. 
  </t>
  <t>If a DOCA server does not have a common scope with a DOCA client or

  <t>The absence of the OC-Applications AVP indicates the Diameter node has

   Tolc timer value in milliseconds. This timer defines the interval for
   sending periodic DOCA-Report-Request messages with the OC-Action AVP set
   to 'Interim'. The value of zero (0) means no periodic DOCA-Report-Request 
   messages are sent or desired. The default value is 120000.
  </t>
  <t>The OC-Tocl AVP can be considered
   as a hint for a desired sending rate of subsequent messages.
  </t>
  <t>If a DOCA server find the Tocl value proposed by a DOCA client either
   too small (i.e. too frequent periodic messages) or too big (i.e. too
   seldom periodic messages), then the DOCA server MUST send the
   DOCA-Report-Answer indicating an error and set the Result-Code either to the 
   DIAMETER_TOCL_TOO_SMALL or DIAMETER_TOCL_TOO_BIG value. 
  </t>

 <section title="OC-Sending-Rate AVP" anchor="oc-sending-rate">
  <t>The OC-Sending-Rate (AVP Code TBD11) is of type Float32 and tells the
   the maximum Diameter message sending rate per second the sender of this
   information wishes to receive Diameter messages. Only positive values
   are valid. A value of zero (0.0) of the absence of this AVP means the
   information sender has no specific rate preference.
  </t>
  <t>If a DOCA server finds the sending rate value proposed by a DOCA client
   too big (i.e., too frequent periodic messages), then the DOCA server

 <section title="OC-Best-Before AVP" anchor="oc-best-before">
  <t>The OC-Best-Before (AVP Code TBD12) is of type Time and tells
   the expiration time/date for the information received in the OC-Information.
   For example, when the overload condition is on, the expiration of
   the 'best before' timer causes the same as receiving a
   DOCA-Report-Request/Answer with the OC-Action set to 'Stop'.

  <t>The OC-Origin (AVP Code TBD13) is of type DiameterIdentity and tells
   the identity of the Diameter node that originated included the overload
   control information. Both host and realm information MUST be included in
   the OC-Origin AVP. Note, if the OC-Scope AVP indicates only a realm wide
   scope for the overload information, then the realm part of the OC-Origin AVP
   is meaningful and the host information only serves as an additional

   AVP means there is not specific priority level defined and the priority
   SHOULD be considered as the lowest possible.

<section title="Transport Considerations" anchor="sctp">
 <t>In case of Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) transport,
  the DOCA application is RECOMMENDED to mark its Diameter packets using
  the DOCA defined SCTP Payload Protocol Identifier (PPID) TBD1. The PPID MAY
  be used by intermediating network nodes or agents to peek into SCTP
  message and find out that this is about overload control. Such information
  can be used for prioritizing SCTP packet handling as an example.
 </t>
</section>

<section title="Examples">

<t>Consider the following simplified scenario shown in <xref target="example1"/> where two servers 
are connected to a proxy. All three nodes understand the DOCA application. These three nodes belong to the same administrative domain and the operator decided that he wants to hide the Diameter topology of his own network. Consequently, aggregate information is provided by the proxy for any Diameter overload message exchange. The Diameter client also supports the DOCA application. Between the client and the Diameter proxy we assume an arbitrary Diameter network that passes Diameter messages back and forth.

Let us assume that the DOCA exchange is initiated by server 1 who determines that the load situation increases. It sends a DOCA-Report-Request message (with piggybacked overload information) towards the client. The message also instructs the client to reduce it's sending rate. The proxy, who receives the DOCA-Report-Request decides to change the included OC-Origin information and forwards the request to the client.</t>

<t>When the client receives the DOCA-Report-Request message is processes the content, evaluates the overload information content and reacts accordingly, and returns a DOCA-Report-Answer message back to acknowledge the receipt. </t>

<t>Alternatively, let us assume that the proxy does not forward the message but instead terminates the DOCA-Report-Request received from Server 1. 
It instead decides to route traffic to the backup server, Server 2. In this case the entire process was transparent for the client.</t>

<section title="Security Considerations">
 <t>The security properties of the Diameter Overload Control Application

  This implies there is no proper means to verify the message and AVP content
  correctness if multiple intermediate Diameter agents are present on the
  path between the DOCA client and server. As a result a malicious intermediate
  could feed incorrect overload control information to DOCA clients and peers, 
  and thus affect negatively to the overload condition recovery. A possible way 
  to overcome the obvious security vulnerability is to mandate the use of end-to-end security
  at the Diameter AVP level.
 </t>
 
 <t>As such, like any other Diameter application this document would benefit from a Diameter end-to-end security 
 mechanism. While work is in progress it has not yet been finalized and therefore this specification 
 does not rely on it.

  <section title="Design Justification">
    <t><xref target="introduction"/> discussed the motivation and the background for the
  Diameter enhancements for an explicit Diameter overload control solution. This
  specification solves the overload control at the application level instead of
  extending the Diameter base protocol or piggybacking overload control 
  information on top of existing applications. The reasoning
  is the following:
 </t>
 <t>
  <list style="numbers">
   <t>The support for Diameter overload control capability between Diameter
    peers is explicit (i.e., a new application-id is advertised) and thus not 
    build on an exchange of optional Attribute Value Pairs (AVPs).
   </t>
   <t>The support for Diameter overload control capability between Diameter
    client and server is explicit.
   </t>
   <t>The peer selection follows the existing standards including DNS-based 
    discovery <xref target="RFC6408"/> and does not assume additional peer
    selection criteria learnt from an exchange of optional AVPs.
   </t>
   <t>The application based solution is able to traverse and also
    propagate overload control information through realms that deploy relay agents without Diameter overload control support.
   </t>
   <t>The propagation does not depend on a modified behavior of already specified Diameter command codes.
   </t>
   <t>Pretending not to establish a state when there actually is an overload
    capability and information state still maintained. The state might not be
    at the application level but is there.
   </t>
   <t>Trying to avoid information flooding, especially across administrative
    domains.
   </t>
   <t>The use of the application concept allows established mechanisms for filtering and Diameter
    traffic engineering, since it behaves like any other Diameter application.</t>
	<t>The use of the dedicated application allows to isolate (even physically)
      the overload signaling into a dedicated transport that is not affected
      by other Diameter messages and network traffic.</t>
